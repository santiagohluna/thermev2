Analytic determinations of tidal dissipation in a homogeneous, incompressible Moon and in a two-layer Moon with a soft core and rigid mantle are given as a function of position in the Moon and as a function of Earth-Moon separation. The most recent information on the historical values of the lunar obliquity is employed, and we present results for the constant values of orbital eccentricity of e = 0.0 and e = 0.055. For a simplified orbital evolution and a dissipation factor Q = 100, the total increase in the mean lunar temperature for the homogeneous case does not exceed several tens of degrees. For the two-layer models the local dissipation may be enhanced over that of the homogeneous Moon by a factor of 5 for a core radius of 0.5 lunar radii and by a factor of 100 for a core radius of 0.95 lunar radii. The corresponding factors for the total dissipation are 3 and 15 for the two values of core radii, respectively. We conclude that tidal contributions to lunar thermal history are probably not important. But under special circumstances the enhanced dissipation in a two-layer Moon could have led to a spectacular thermal event."

abstract = {Abstract: Both orbital and attitude dynamics employ the method of variation of parameters. In a non-perturbed setting, the coordinates (or the Euler angles) are expressed as functions of the time and six adjustable constants called elements. Under disturbance, each such expression becomes ansatz, the “constants” being endowed with time dependence. The perturbed velocity (linear or angular) consists of a partial time derivative and a convective term containing time derivatives of the “constants.” It can be shown that this construction leaves one with a freedom to impose three arbitrary conditions on the “constants” and/or their derivatives. Out of convenience, the Lagrange constraint is often imposed. It nullifies the convective term and thereby guarantees that under perturbation the functional dependence of the velocity upon the time and “constants” stays the same as in the undisturbed case. “Constants” obeying this condition are called osculating elements. The “constants” chosen to be canonical, are called Delaunay elements, in the orbital case, or Andoyer elements, in the spin case. (Because some of the Andoyer elements are time dependent, even in the free-spin case, the role of “constants” is played by the initial values of these elements.) The Andoyer and Delaunay sets of elements share a feature not readily apparent: in certain cases the standard equations render these elements non-osculating. In orbital mechanics, elements calculated via the standard planetary equations turn out to be non-osculating when perturbations depend on velocities. To keep elements osculating under such perturbations, the equations must be amended with additional terms that are not parts of the disturbing function (Efroimsky and Goldreich 2003, 2004). For the Kepler elements, this merely complicates the equations. In the case of Delaunay parameterization, these extra terms not only complicate the equations, but also destroy their canonicity. So under velocity-dependent disturbances, osculation and canonicity are incompatible. Similarly, in spin dynamics the Andoyer elements turn out to be non-osculating under angular-velocity-dependent perturbation (a switch to a noninertial frame being one such case). Amendment of the dynamical equations only with extra terms in the Hamiltonian makes the equations render nonosculating Andoyer elements. To make them osculating, more terms must enter the equations (and the equations will no longer be canonical). It is often convenient to deliberately deviate from osculation by substituting the Lagrange constraint with an arbitrary condition that gives birth to a family of nonosculating elements. The freedom in choosing this condition is analogous to the gauge freedom. Calculations in nonosculating variables are mathematically valid and sometimes highly advantageous, but their physical interpretation is nontrivial. For example, nonosculating orbital elements parameterize instantaneous conics not tangent to the orbit, so the nonosculating inclination will be different from the real inclination of the physical orbit. We present examples of situations in which ignorance of the gauge freedom (and of the unwanted loss of osculation) leads to oversights.},

abstract="It was believed until very recently that a near-equatorial satellite would always keep up with the planet's equator (with oscillations in inclination, but without a secular drift). As explained in Efroimsky and Goldreich [Astronomy {\&} Astrophysics (2004) Vol. 415, pp. 1187--1199], this misconception originated from a wrong interpretation of a (mathematically correct) result obtained in terms of non-osculating orbital elements. A similar analysis carried out in the language of osculating elements will endow the planetary equations with some extra terms caused by the planet's obliquity change. Some of these terms will be non-trivial, in that they will not be amendments to the disturbing function. Due to the extra terms, the variations of a planet's obliquity may cause a secular drift of its satellite orbit inclination. In this article we set out the analytical formalism for our study of this drift. We demonstrate that, in the case of uniform precession, the drift will be extremely slow, because the first-order terms responsible for the drift will be short-period and, thus, will have vanishing orbital averages (as anticipated 40 years ago by Peter Goldreich), while the secular terms will be of the second order only. However, it turns out that variations of the planetary precession make the first-order terms secular. For example, the planetary nutations will resonate with the satellite's orbital frequency and, thereby, may instigate a secular drift. A detailed study of this process will be offered in a subsequent publication, while here we work out the required mathematical formalism and point out the key aspects of the dynamics.",

	abstract = {Tidal torques play a key role in rotational dynamics of celestial bodies. They govern these bodies' tidal despinning and also participate in the subtle process of entrapment of these bodies into spin-orbit resonances. This makes tidal torques directly relevant to the studies of habitability of planets and their moons. Our work begins with an explanation of how friction and lagging should be built into the theory of bodily tides. Although much of this material can be found in various publications, a short but self-consistent summary on the topic has been lacking in the hitherto literature, and we are filling the gap. After these preparations, we address a popular concise formula for the tidal torque, which is often used in the literature, for planets or stars. We explain why the derivation of this expression, offered in the paper by Goldreich and in the books by Kaula (Equation (4.5.29)) and Murray & Dermott (Equation (4.159)), implicitly sets the time lag to be frequency independent. Accordingly, the ensuing expression for the torque can be applied only to bodies having a very special (and very hypothetical) rheology which makes the time lag frequency independent, i.e., the same for all Fourier modes in the spectrum of tide. This expression for the torque should not be used for bodies of other rheologies. Specifically, the expression cannot be combined with an extra assertion of the geometric lag being constant, because at finite eccentricities the said assumption is incompatible with the constant-time-lag condition.}

	abstract = {This is a pilot paper serving as a launching pad for study of orbital and spin evolution of binary asteroids. The rate of tidal evolution of asteroidal binaries is defined by the dynamical Love numbers kl divided by quality factors Q. Common in the literature is the (oftentimes illegitimate) approximation of the dynamical Love numbers with their static counterparts. Since the static Love numbers are, approximately, proportional to the inverse rigidity, this renders a popular fallacy that the tidal evolution rate is determined by the product of the rigidity by the quality factor: . In reality, the dynamical Love numbers depend on the tidal frequency and all rheological parameters of the tidally perturbed body (not just rigidity). We demonstrate that in asteroidal binaries the rigidity of their components plays virtually no role in tidal friction and tidal lagging, and thereby has almost no influence on the intensity of tidal interactions (tidal torques, tidal dissipation, tidally induced changes of the orbit). A key quantity that overwhelmingly determines the tidal evolution is a product of the effective viscosity  by the tidal frequency . The functional form of the torque’s dependence on this product depends on who wins in the competition between viscosity and self-gravitation. Hence a quantitative criterion, to distinguish between two regimes. For higher values of , we get ,  for lower values we obtain . Our study rests on an assumption that asteroids can be treated as Maxwell bodies. Applicable to rigid rocks at low frequencies, this approximation is used here also for rubble piles, due to the lack of a better model. In the future, as we learn more about mechanics of granular mixtures in a weak gravity field, we may have to amend the tidal theory with other rheological parameters, ones that do not show up in the description of viscoelastic bodies. This line of study provides a tool to exploring the orbital history of asteroidal pairs, as well as of their final spin states.}

    abstract = "{Tidal friction is thought to be important in determining the long-term spin-orbit evolution of short-period extrasolar planetary systems. Using a simple model of the orbit-averaged effects of tidal friction, we study the evolution of close-in planets on inclined orbits, due to tides. We analyse the effects of the inclusion of stellar magnetic braking by performing a phase-plane analysis of a simplified system of equations, including the braking torque. The inclusion of magnetic braking is found to be important, and its neglect can result in a very different system history. We then present the results of numerical integrations of the tidal evolution equations, where we find that it is essential to consider coupled evolution of the orbital and rotational elements, including dissipation in both the star and planet, to accurately model the evolution.The main result of our integrations is that for typical Hot Jupiters, tidal friction aligns the stellar spin with the orbit on a similar time as it causes the orbit to decay. This tells us that if a planet is observed to be aligned, then it probably formed coplanar. This reinforces the importance of Rossiter–McLaughlin effect observations in determining the degree of spin-orbit alignment in transiting systems.We apply these results to the only observed system with a spin-orbit misalignment, XO-3, and constrain the efficiency of tidal dissipation (i.e. the modified tidal quality factors Q′) in both the star and the planet in this system. Using a model in which inertial waves are excited by tidal forcing in the outer convective envelope and dissipated by turbulent viscosity, we calculate Q′ for a range of F-star models, and find it to vary considerably within this class of stars. This means that using a single Q′, and assuming that it applies to all stars, is probably incorrect. In addition, we propose an explanation for the survival of two of the planets on the tightest orbits, WASP-12 b and OGLE-TR-56 b, in terms of weak dissipation in the star, as a result of their internal structures and slow rotation periods.}",

Tidal interaction can modify the dynamics of the system through orbital alignment, circularization, synchronization and orbital decay by exchange of angular moment. Evidence for tidal circularization in close–in giant planet is well known. Here, we review the evidence for excess rotation of the parent stars due to the pull of tidal forces towards spin–orbit synchronization. We find suggestive empirical evidence for such a process in the present sample of transiting planetary systems. The corresponding angular momentum exchange would imply that some planets have spiralled towards their star by substantial amounts since the dissipation of the protoplanetary disc. We suggest that this could quantitatively account for the observed mass–period relation of close–in gas giants. We discuss how this scenario can be further tested and point out some consequences for theoretical studies of tidal interactions and for the detection and confirmation of transiting planets from radial velocity and photometric surveys.}",

abstract = {The present rate of tidal dissipation in the Earth-Moon system is known to be anomalously high, in the sense that the implied age of the lunar orbit is only 1.5×109 years, though other evidence suggests an age closer to 4×109 years. To assess how long the anomalous dissipation has persisted, we use published estimates of lunar orbital configurations derived from (a) fine grained sediments containing tidal laminations and (b) numerical ocean models averaged over varying ocean geometries. The implied histories of the lunar semimajor axis are surprisingly consistent over the past 109 years. The ocean models imply, on average, reduced dissipation in the past because of a spatial mismatch between tidal forcing and oceanic normal modes of higher frequencies. Webb's ocean model suggests that the “anomalous” oceanic dissipation began about 109 years ago and has been increasing since then.},

The subroutine applies Risbo's approach to evaluate, for a given inclination, stably and accurately, the necessary d-functions up to a specified degree, whilst at the same time `rotating' (for each degree in turn) the values of the harmonic coefficients. We follow Risbo's helpful example by including a listing of the new subroutine.",

abstract = "Internal dissipation in a tidally perturbed librating body differs in several respects from the tidal dissipation in a steadily spinning rotator. First, libration changes the spectral distribution of tidal damping across the tidal modes, as compared to the case of steady spin. This changes both the tidal heating rate and the tidal torque. Second, while a non-librating rotator experiences alternating deformation only due to the potential force exerted on it by the perturber, a librating body is also subject to a toroidal force proportional to the angular acceleration. Third, while the centrifugal force in a steadily spinning body renders only a permanent deformation (which defines the oblateness when the body cools down), in a librating body this force contains two alternating components—one purely radial, another a degree-2 potential force. Both contribute to heating, as well as to the tidal torque and potential (and, thereby, to the orbital evolution). We develop a formalism needed to describe dissipation in a homogeneous terrestrial body performing small-amplitude libration in longitude. This formalism incorporates as its part a linear rheological law defining the response of the rotator’s material to forcing. While the developed formalism can work with an arbitrary linear rheology, we consider a simple example of a Maxwell material. We demonstrate that, independent of the rheology, forced libration in longitude can provide a considerable and even leading—and sometimes overwhelming—input in the tidal heating. Based on the observed parameters, this input amounts to 52\% in Phobos, 33\% in Mimas, 23\% in Enceladus, and 96\% in Epimetheus. This supports the hypothesis by Makarov and Efroimsky (2014) that the additional tidal damping due to forced libration may have participated in the early heating up of some of the large moons. As one possibility, such a moon could have been chipped by collisions—whereby it acquired a higher permanent triaxiality and, therefore, a higher forced-libration magnitude and, consequently, a higher heating rate. After the moon warms up, its permanent triaxiality decreases, and so does the tidal heating rate."

abstract="The Darwin-Kaula theory of bodily tides is intended for celestial bodies rotating without libration. We demonstrate that this theory, in its customary form, is inapplicable to a librating body. Specifically, in the presence of libration in longitude, the actual spectrum of Fourier tidal modes differs from the conventional spectrum rendered by the Darwin--Kaula theory for a nonlibrating celestial object. This necessitates derivation of formulae for the tidal torque and the tidal heating rate, that are applicable under libration. We derive the tidal spectrum for longitudinal forced libration with one and two main frequencies, generalisation to more main frequencies being straightforward. (By main frequencies we understand those emerging due to the triaxiality of the librating body.) Separately, we consider a case of free libration at one frequency (once again, generalisation to more frequencies being straightforward). We also calculate the tidal torque. This torque provides correction to the triaxiality-caused physical libration. Our theory is not self-consistent: we assume that the tidal torque is much smaller than the permanent-triaxiality-caused torque, so the additional libration due to tides is much weaker than the main libration due to the permanent triaxiality. Finally, we calculate the tidal dissipation rate in a body experiencing forced libration at the main mode, or free libration at one frequency, or superimposed forced and free librations.",

    abstract = "{Perturbations of all sorts destabilize the rotation of a small body and leave it in a non-principal spin state. In such a state, the body experiences alternating stresses generated by the inertial forces. This yields nutation relaxation, i.e. evolution of the spin towards the principal rotation about the maximal-inertia axis. Knowledge of the time-scales needed to damp the nutation is crucial in studies of small bodies’ dynamics. In the literature hitherto, nutation relaxation has always been described with aid of an empirical quality factor  Q introduced to parametrize the energy dissipation rate. Among the drawbacks of this approach was its inability to describe the dependence of the relaxation rate upon the current nutation angle. This inability stemmed from our lack of knowledge of the quality factor's dependence on the forcing frequency. In this article, we derive our description of nutation damping directly from the rheological law obeyed by the material. This renders us the nutation damping rate as a function of the current nutation angle, as well as of the shape and the rheological parameters of the body. In contradistinction from the approach based on an empirical  Q  factor, our development gives a zero damping rate in the spherical-shape limit. Our method is generic and applicable to any shape and to any linear rheological law. However, to simplify the developments, here we consider a dynamically oblate rotator with a Maxwell rheology.}",

Among these is the mode of convection, which influences a planet's thermal evolution and surface conditions. On Earth, plate tectonics has been proposed as a necessary condition for life. Here we show that super-Earths will also have plate tectonics. We demonstrate that as planetary mass increases, the shear stress available to overcome resistance to plate motion increases while the plate thickness decreases, thereby enhancing plate weakness. These effects contribute favorably to the subduction of the lithosphere, an essential component of plate tectonics. Moreover, uncertainties in achieving plate tectonics in the 1 M⊕ regime disappear as mass increases: super-Earths, even if dry, will exhibit plate tectonic behavior.}

Because of the connection to habitability through thermal evolution, we investigate the tectonic regime of massive terrestrial planets. Two independent studies [O'Neill, C., Lenardic, A., Oct 2007. Geological consequences of super-sized earths. GRL 34, L19204, Valencia, D., O'Connell, R.J., Sasselov, D. D., Nov 2007a. Inevitability of plate tectonics on super-earths. ApJL 670, L45–L48.] have reached opposing conclusions about the likelihood of plate tectonics. Here, we offer possible reasons for the discordant findings and address three key aspects of sustaining plate tectonics: deformation on faults, negative buoyancy and energy dissipation during subduction. We show that in general, the ratio of driving force to plate resistance increases with planetary mass. This is a consequence of increasing convective stresses, thinning plates and similar plate structure. We conclude that even though the strength of dry and wet of faults increases for massive terrestrial planets, the convective stress increases even more allowing deformation to take place. Also, despite shorter timescales for plate cooling, rocky super-Earths achieve negative buoyancy at subduction zones. Finally, by investigating the effects of energy dissipation during subduction we find that massive terrestrial planets dissipate less energy during subduction and hence provide a positive feedback to sustain active-lid tectonics. In conclusion, rocky super-Earths have more favorable conditions than Earth for the subduction of plates, and hence, for sustaining plate tectonics."

	abstract = {The stability of Earth’s climate on geological timescales is enabled by the carbon–silicate cycle that acts as a negative feedback mechanism stabilizing surface temperatures via the intake and outgassing of atmospheric carbon. On Earth, this thermostat is enabled by plate tectonics that sequesters outgassed CO2 back into the mantle via weathering and subduction at convergent margins. Here we propose a separate tectonic mechanism—vertical recycling—that can serve as the vehicle for CO2 outgassing and sequestration over long timescales. The mechanism requires continuous tidal heating, which makes it particularly relevant to planets in the habitable zone of M stars. Dynamical models of this vertical recycling scenario and stability analysis show that temperate climates stable over timescales of billions of years are realized for a variety of initial conditions, even as the M star dims over time. The magnitude of equilibrium surface temperatures depends on the interplay of sea weathering and outgassing, which in turn depends on planetary carbon content, so that planets with lower carbon budgets are favored for temperate conditions. The habitability of planets such as found in the Trappist-1 system may be rooted in tidally driven tectonics.}

Here, we illustrate a procedure for computing the tidal interaction between a white dwarf and a near-spherical solid planet. This method determines the planet’s inward and/or outward drift, and whether the planet will reach the Roche radius and be destroyed. We avoid constant tidal lag formulations and instead employ the self-consistent secular Darwin–Kaula expansions from Boué \\&amp; Efroimsky (2019), which feature an arbitrary frequency dependence on the quality functions. We adopt wide ranges of dynamic viscosities and spin rates for the planet in order to straddle many possible outcomes, and provide a foundation for the future study of individual systems with known or assumed rheologies.

Formulae for these rates appeared in the literature in various forms, at times with errors. We reconsider, from scratch, the derivation of these rates and arrive at the Lagrange-type equations which, in some details, differ from the corresponding equations obtained previously by Kaula (Rev Geophys 2:661--684, 1964). We also write down detailed expressions for {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}d{\}}{\}}a{\{}/{\}}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}d{\}}{\}}t{\$}{\$}da/dt, {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}d{\}}{\}}e{\{}/{\}}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}d{\}}{\}}t{\$}{\$}de/dtand {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}d{\}}{\}}i{\{}/{\}}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}d{\}}{\}}t{\$}{\$}di/dt, to order {\$}{\$}e^4{\$}{\$}e4.

As Kaula was interested in the Earth--Moon system, this redundant factor was close to unity and was unimportant in his developments. This factor, however, must be removed when Kaula's theory is applied to a binary composed of partners of comparable masses. We have found that while it is legitimate to simply sum the primary's and secondary's inputs in {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}d{\}}{\}}a{\{}/{\}}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}d{\}}{\}}t{\$}{\$}da/dtor {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}d{\}}{\}}e{\{}/{\}}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}d{\}}{\}}t{\$}{\$}de/dt, this is not the case for {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}d{\}}{\}}i{\{}/{\}}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}d{\}}{\}}t{\$}{\$}di/dt. So our expression for {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}d{\}}{\}}i{\{}/{\}}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}d{\}}{\}}t{\$}{\$}di/dtdiffers from that of Kaula in two regards. First, the contribution due to the dissipation in the secondary averages out when the apsidal precession is uniform. Second, we have obtained an additional term which emerges owing to the conservation of the angular momentum: a change in the inclination of the orbit causes a change of the primary's plane of equator.",

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {The advanced rheological models of Andrade and Sundberg & Cooper are compared to the traditional Maxwell model to understand how each affects the tidal dissipation of heat within rocky bodies. We find both Andrade and Sundberg–Cooper rheologies can produce at least 10× the tidal heating compared to a traditional Maxwell model for a warm (1400–1600 K) Io-like satellite. Sundberg–Cooper can cause even larger dissipation around a critical temperature and frequency. These models allow cooler planets to stay tidally active in the face of orbital perturbations—a condition we term “tidal resilience.” This has implications for the time evolution of tidally active worlds and the long-term equilibria they fall into. For instance, if Io’s interior is better modeled by the Andrade or Sundberg–Cooper rheologies, the number of possible resonance-forming scenarios that still produce a hot, modern Io is expanded, and these scenarios do not require an early formation of the Laplace resonance. The two primary empirical parameters that define the Andrade anelasticity are examined in several phase spaces to provide guidance on how their uncertainties impact tidal outcomes, as laboratory studies continue to constrain their real values. We provide detailed reference tables on the fully general equations required for others to insert the models of Andrade and Sundberg–Cooper into standard tidal formulae. Lastly, we show that advanced rheologies can greatly impact the heating of short-period exoplanets and exomoons, while the properties of tidal resilience could mean a greater number of tidally active worlds among all extrasolar systems.}

The torque equations are integrated numerically with a small step in time, including the oscillating triaxial torque components but neglecting the layered structure of the planet and assuming a zero obliquity. We find that a Mercury-like planet with a current value of orbital eccentricity (0.2056) is always captured in 3:2 resonance. The probability of capture in the higher 2:1 resonance is approximately 0.23. These results are confirmed by a semi-analytical estimation of capture probabilities as functions of eccentricity for both prograde and retrograde evolutions of spin rate. As follows from analysis of equilibrium torques, entrapment in 3:2 resonance is inevitable at eccentricities between 0.2 and 0.41. Considering the phase space parameters at the times of periastron, the range of spin rates and phase angles for which an immediate resonance passage is triggered is very narrow, and yet a planet like Mercury rarely fails to align itself into this state of unstable equilibrium before it traverses 2:1 resonance.}

	abstract = {GJ 581d is a potentially habitable super-Earth in the multiple system of exoplanets orbiting a nearby M dwarf. We investigate this planet's long-term dynamics with an emphasis on its probable final rotation states acquired via tidal interaction with the host. The published radial velocities for the star are re-analyzed with a benchmark planet detection algorithm to confirm that there is no evidence for the recently proposed two additional planets (f and g). Limiting the scope to the four originally detected planets, we assess the dynamical stability of the system and find bounded chaos in the orbital motion. For the planet d, the characteristic Lyapunov time is 38 yr. Long-term numerical integration reveals that the system of four planets is stable, with the eccentricity of the planet d changing quasi-periodically in a tight range around 0.27, and with its semimajor axis varying only a little. The spin-orbit interaction of GJ 581d with its host star is dominated by the tides exerted by the star on the planet. We model this interaction, assuming a terrestrial composition of the mantle. Besides the triaxiality-caused torque and the secular part of the tidal torque, which are conventionally included in the equation of motion, we also include the tidal torques’ oscillating components. It turns out that, depending on the mantle temperature, the planet gets trapped into the 2:1 or an even higher spin-orbit resonance. It is very improbable that the planet could have reached the 1:1 resonance. This improves the possibility of the planet being suitable for sustained life.}

  abstract = {Much of the Earth's mantle was melted in the Moon-forming impact. Gases that were not partially soluble in the melt, such as water and CO2, formed a thick, deep atmosphere surrounding the post-impact Earth. This atmosphere was opaque to thermal radiation, allowing heat to escape to space only at the runaway greenhouse threshold of approximately 100 W m−2. The duration of this runaway greenhouse stage was limited to approximately 10 Myr by the internal energy and tidal heating, ending with a partially crystalline uppermost mantle and a solid deep mantle. At this point, the crust was able to cool efficiently and solidified at the surface. After the condensation of the water ocean, approximately 100 bar of CO2 remained in the atmosphere, creating a solar-heated greenhouse, while the surface cooled to approximately 500 K. Almost all this CO2 had to be sequestered by subduction into the mantle by 3.8 Ga, when the geological record indicates the presence of life and hence a habitable environment. The deep CO2 sequestration into the mantle could be explained by a rapid subduction of the old oceanic crust, such that the top of the crust would remain cold and retain its CO2. Kinematically, these episodes would be required to have both fast subduction (and hence seafloor spreading) and old crust. Hadean oceanic crust that formed from hot mantle would have been thicker than modern crust, and therefore only old crust underlain by cool mantle lithosphere could subduct. Once subduction started, the basaltic crust would turn into dense eclogite, increasing the rate of subduction. The rapid subduction would stop when the young partially frozen crust from the rapidly spreading ridge entered the subduction zone.},

abstract = "Plate tectonics on Earth is driven by the subduction and stirring of dense oceanic lithosphere into the underlying mantle. For such a regime to exist on any planet, stresses associated with mantle convection must exceed the strength of the lithosphere. This condition is sufficiently restrictive that plate tectonics currently operates only on Earth, and mantle convection in most terrestrial planets and moons is probably in a stagnant lid regime. Convective stresses on the lithosphere depend on the viscosity and velocity of underlying cold downwellings. The lithospheric yield stress is controlled by its friction coefficient and elastic thickness (the depth to the brittle–ductile transition or BDT). Both convective stresses and the plate's yield strength depend critically on the size, thermal state and cooling history of a planet. Accordingly, here we use numerical simulations and scaling theory to identify conditions in which mantle convection leads to lithospheric failure for a range of conditions relevant to the terrestrial planets. Whereas Earth is expected to be in a plate-tectonic regime over its full thermal evolution, the Moon and Mercury are expected to have always remained in a stagnant lid regime. Venus, Io and Europa currently fall on the transition between the two regimes, which is consistent with an episodic style of mantle convection for Venus, a tectonic component to deformation on Io, and the resurfacing history and lithospheric evolution of Europa. Our results suggest that Venus may have been in a plate-tectonic regime in the past. While stagnant now, it is plausible that Mars may have also been in an active-lid regime, depending on whether there was liquid water on the surface."

abstract = {The Earth as a planetary system has experienced significant change since its formation c. 4.54 Gyr ago. Some of these changes have been gradual, such as secular cooling of the mantle, and some have been abrupt, such as the rapid increase in free oxygen in the atmosphere at the Archean–Proterozoic transition. Many of these changes have directly affected tectonic processes on Earth and are manifest by temporal trends within the sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rock record. Indeed, the timing of global onset of mobile-lid (subduction-driven) plate tectonics on our planet remains one of the fundamental points of debate within the geosciences today, and constraining the age and cause of this transition has profound implications for understanding our own planet's long-term evolution, and that for other rocky bodies in our solar system. Interpretations based on various sources of evidence have led different authors to propose a very wide range of ages for the onset of subduction-driven tectonics, which span almost all of Earth history from the Hadean to the Neoproterozoic, with this uncertainty stemming from the varying reliability of different proxies. Here, we review evidence for paleo-subduction preserved within the geological record, with a focus on metamorphic rocks and the geodynamic information that can be derived from them. First, we describe the different types of tectonic/geodynamic regimes that may occur on Earth or any other silicate body, and then review different models for the thermal evolution of the Earth and the geodynamic conditions necessary for plate tectonics to stabilize on a rocky planet. The community's current understanding of the petrology and structure of Archean and Proterozoic oceanic and continental crust is then discussed in comparison with modern-day equivalents, including how and why they differ. We then summarize evidence for the operation of subduction through time, including petrological (metamorphic), tectonic, and geochemical/isotopic data, and the results of petrological and geodynamical modeling. The styles of metamorphism in the Archean are then examined and we discuss how the secular distribution of metamorphic rock types can inform the type of geodynamic regime that operated at any point in time. In conclusion, we argue that most independent observations from the geological record and results of lithospheric-scale geodynamic modeling support a global-scale initiation of plate tectonics no later than c. 3 Ga, just preceding the Archean–Proterozoic transition. Evidence for subduction in Early Archean terranes is likely accounted for by localized occurrences of plume-induced subduction initiation, although these did not develop into a stable, globally connected network of plate boundaries until later in Earth history. Finally, we provide a discussion of major unresolved questions related to this review's theme and provide suggested directions for future research.}

All of these changes may be tied directly or indirectly to cooling of Earth's mantle and corresponding changes in convective style and the strength of the lithosphere, and they may record the gradual onset and propagation of plate tectonics around the planet. To further understand the changes that occurred between 3 and 2 Ga, it is necessary to compare rocks, rock associations, tectonics and geochemistry during and between zircon age peaks. Geochemistry of peak and inter-peak basalts and TTGs needs to be evaluated in terms of geodynamic models that predict the existence of an episodic thermal regime between stagnant-lid and plate tectonic regimes in early planetary evolution."

Planetary interiors typical incorporate complex rheologies, viscous layering, lateral heterogeneities, and time delays in processes, which have not been traditionally represented by parameterised approaches. Here we develop numerical models for planetary evolution, incorporating the physical complexity of Earth’s interior, and use them to generate statistically-based Nu-Ra scalings. These encapsulate the main effects of tectonic transitions, geometry, and depth-dependent rheology, and time-sensitivity. We find an exponent β of ~0.26 best describes the Nu-Ra relationship for evolving mobile lid systems, and β ~0.12 for stagnant-lid systems. Systems with time dependent subduction have β varying between ~0.26 during the Hadean, when external factors such as impacts facilitate tectonics, to ~0.12 during the Archaean, when the system is dominated by long periods of quiescence, and systems driven by external forcings (eg. due to impacts in the first 100Myr of Earth’s history) may exhibit much higher exponents. We also find a time-lag between Ra (which primarily depends on mantle temperature) and Nu (normalised surface heat flow) of around 200–300Myr, suggesting a significant delay between mantle thermal configuration, and its surface manifestation. These results provide an approach for the rapid characterisation of tectonic, volcanic, and atmospheric evolution of terrestrial exoplanets.}

We know that these ancient zircons yield relatively low crystallization temperatures and some are enriched in heavy oxygen, contain inclusions similar to modern crustal processes, and show evidence of silicate differentiation at ∼4.5 Ga. These observations are interpreted to reflect an early terrestrial hydrosphere, early felsic crust in which granitoids were produced and later weathered under high water activity conditions, and even the possible existence of plate boundary interactions—in strong contrast to the traditional view of an uninhabitable, hellish world. Possible scenarios are explored with a view to reconciling this growing but fragmentary record with our knowledge of conditions then extant in the inner solar system.},

abstract = "The inclusion mineralogy of 1450 zircons over 4billion years in age from the Jack Hills, Western Australia, was characterized for composition and phase assemblage. Results confirm that the inclusion population of these largely igneous zircons is dominated by muscovite and quartz (~75\%). If the inclusions are original to the igneous zircons, this observation alone restricts the host melts to formation at pressure–temperature (P–T) conditions of ~650–800°C and >4kbar. Several lines of evidence support the view that most of the analyzed mineral inclusions are primary, including their lack of association with cracks, magmatic crystal forms, and lack of exchange with fuchsitic (Cr-rich) micas in the host conglomerate. The application of Ti-in-zircon thermometry, and phengite, Ti-in-quartz, and Al-in-hornblende barometry to these inclusion assemblages yields estimates of magmatic P–T conditions from 5 to >12kbar and 700±40°C. These data indicate zircon formation along geotherms of ≤60°C/km and imply conductive near-surface heat flow of <40 to 85mW/m2—a range that is substantially lower than most estimates of global Hadean heat flow. Of the possible environments capable of generating melting under such locally low heat flow early in Earth history, underthrusting, possibly in a manner similar to modern convergent margins, appears most consistent with numerous other geochemical constraints derived from investigation of Hadean zircons."

abstract = "There is no consensus on the processes responsible for near-coeval formation of Archaean continental crust (dominantly tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite: TTG), greenstone belts dominated by komatiitic to tholeiitic lavas (KT), and sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). The Douglas Harbour domain (2.7–2.9Ga) of the Minto Block, northeastern Superior Province, has two TTG suites, the western and eastern Faribault–Thury (WFT and EFT), with embedded KT greenstones. Tonalites of both suites have high light/heavy rare-earth element ratios (L/HREE), high large ion lithophile element (U–Th–Rb–Cs–La: LILE) contents, positive Sr–Pb anomalies, and negative Nb–Ta–Ti anomalies. Such typical Archaean TTG signatures are commonly explained by melting of subducted oceanic crust, but could also originate by melting the base of thick basaltic plateaux formed above mantle upwellings (plumes), leaving behind restites containing pyroxene, garnet, and rutile. Field relationships (in situ segregation veins), phase equilibria (hornblende stabilized at lower crustal pressure), petrography (corroded epidote and muscovite phenocrysts, rare plagioclase phenocrysts), and trace element models, all imply that FT tonalite to trondhjemite evolution reflects hornblende-dominated fractional crystallization, not partial melting of subducted crust. The geochemistry of parental FT tonalites can be modeled by 15–30\% melting of FT tholeiitic metabasalts, with residues of eclogite, garnet-websterite, or hornblende-garnet websterite. A minor residual Ti-phase such as rutile is also needed to generate negative Ti–Nb–Ta troughs in the TTGs. However, large volumes of eclogitic restites complementary to TTG are not observed either at the base of Archaean crustal sections, or in the SCLM. Additional problems with slab-melting models include: (a) the rarity of lithologies and associations characteristic of active margins (ophiolites, andesites, blueschists, accretionary mélanges, molasse, flysch, high-pressure belts, and thrust-and-fold belts); (b) the need to deliver plume-derived KT melt through the slab; and (c) extracting enough TTG melt from a subducting slab in the time available (200–300my). In the plateau-melting model, heat for crustal anatexis is supplied by ongoing KT magma derived from mantle upwellings. However, SCLM rocks differ from predicted 1-stage mantle melting residua; and the voluminous residual eclogites complementary to TTG generation somehow need to be removed. These two problems might solve one another if the dense crustal restites disaggregated and mixed into the underlying depleted mantle. Mantle melting slows upon exhaustion of Ca–Al-rich phases, with large temperature increases needed to extract more melt from harzburgite residua. Physical addition of delaminated crustal restites would refertilize the refractory mantle, allowing extraction of additional melt increments, and might explain the ultra-depleted and orthopyroxene-rich nature of the SCLM. A hybrid source composed of 10\% eclogitic restite of EFT tonalite generation, mixed with harzburgitic residues from 25\% melting of primitive mantle, yields model melts with trace element signatures resembling typical Munro komatiites. Variations in the mineralogy and geochemistry of the delaminated component might account for the diversity of komatiite types. Degassing of hornblende-rich delaminated restites would transfer LILE to surrounding depleted mantle and could generate boninites. Fusion of undepleted metabasalt sandwiched among denser restites could generate sanukitoids. Mantle melt pulses generated by catastrophic delamination events would underplate nascent TTG crust and trigger renewed crustal melting, followed by delamination of newly formed eclogitic restites, triggering additional mantle melting, and so on. I posit that delamination of crustal restites catalyzed multi-stage melting of the SCLM and maturation of the Archaean continental crust. Thus, Archaean crust and SCLM are genetically inter-linked, and both form above major mantle upwellings."

abstract = "As a consequence of secular cooling of the Earth, there is generally no modern analog to assist in understanding the tectonic style that may have operated in the Archean. Higher mantle temperatures and higher radiogenic heat production in the Archean Earth would have impacted the thickness and composition of the crust. For this reason, well-constrained numerical modeling, based on the fragmentary evidence preserved in the geological record, is the most appropriate tool to evaluate hypotheses of Archean crust formation. The main lithology of Archean gray gneiss complexes is the sodic tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite (TTG) suite. Melting of hydrated basalt at garnet amphibolite, granulite or eclogite facies conditions is considered to be the dominant process that generated the Archean TTGs. Taking into account geochemical signatures of possible mantle contributions to some TTGs, models proposed for the formation of Archean crust include subduction, melting at the bottom of thickened continental crust and fractional crystallization of mantle-derived melts under water-saturated conditions. We evaluated these hypotheses using a 2D coupled petrological-thermomechanical tectono-magmatic numerical model with initial conditions appropriate to the Eoarchean–Mesoarchean. Based on the result of our experiments, we identify three tectonic processes by which intermediate to felsic melts may be generated from hydrated primitive basaltic crust: (1) delamination and dripping of the lower mafic crust into the mantle; (2) local thickening of the crust; and (3) small-scale crustal overturns. In the context of a stagnant-deformable lid tectono-magmatic geodynamic regime that is terminated by short-lived subduction, we identify two distinct types of continental crust. The first type is a pristine granite–greenstone-like crust with dome-and-keel geometry formed over delaminating–upwelling mantle which is mostly subjected to vertical tectonics processes. By contrast, the second type is a reworked (accreted) crust comprising strongly deformed granite–greenstone and subduction-related sequences and subjected to both strong horizontal shortening and vertical tectonics processes. Thus, our study has identified a possible spatial and temporal transition from pristine granite–greenstone-like crust with dome-and-keel geometry to reworked (accreted) crust forming more felsic gneiss terranes in the Archean. We suggest that the contemporaneity of the proposed mechanisms can explain the variety and complexity of the Archean geological record."

Measurements were performed on natural dunite from Åheim (Norway) up to 1400°C and on polycrystalline forsterite up to 1500°C at 1 atm pressure. The two materials were chosen to study, by comparison, the effect of melt on the elasticity and anelasticity of mantle rocks. Between 1000 and 1200°C the absolute values of the shear modulus G are almost equal for both materials. Above 1200°C G for natural dunite decreases progressively with temperature and at 1400°C and 1 Hz reaches ∼13 of its value at 1100°C. In contrast, G of pure forsterite depends little on temperature. For petrological reasons, supported by simultaneous measurements of the electric resistivity, there is strong evidence that the decrease of G in dunite above 1200°C is due to melt from the lower melting components of the dunite. Based on different models estimates of the melt fraction are made. At high temperature, in both materials Q−1 is characterized by a monotonic decrease with frequency according to ω−α, with α ≈ 0.25. An apparent activation energy of 38±5 kcal mol−1 for forsterite and 48±8 kcal mol−1 for dunite was found with no significant change in the regime of partial melting. From this it is concluded that Q−1, even at partial melting, is dominated by solid state high temperature background absorption. There is no indication from these experiments for a constant-Q-band at low seismic frequencies or an increase of Q proportional to frequency as suggested by some seismologists. The present results are in good qualitative agreement with those for Young's modulus obtained previously by strain retardation experiments."

The initial mode of replication, a prerequisite for Darwinian selection, is unknown, but demands an explanation based on local physicochemistry. Dual consideration of the conditions of the early terrestrial surface, with the unusual physicochemical properties of nucleic acids like DNA, could explain the emergence of nucleic acids as key biomolecules. The early impact that produced the Moon, and fast terrestrial rotation, subjected coastal areas 3.9 Ga ago to rapid tidal flooding (dilution) and drying (concentration), with a likely periodicity in the range of 2–6 h, and could have provided a driving force for cyclic replication of early biomolecules. Such a mechanism applies only to molecules capable of association/polymerization at high salt concentration, and of dissociation at low salinity. Nucleic acids meet these criteria. It is suggested that tidal cycling, resembling the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mechanism, could only replicate and amplify DNA-like polymers. This mechanism suggests constraints on the evolution of extra-terrestrial life."

The geologic record of these climate cycles is a powerful tool for reconstructing geologic time, for understanding ancient climate change, and for evaluating the history of our solar system, but their reliability dramatically decreases beyond 50 Ma. Here, we extend the analysis of Milankovitch cycles into the deepest stretches of Earth history, billions of years ago, while simultaneously reconstructing the history of solar system characteristics, including the distance between the Earth and Moon. Our results improve the temporal resolution of ancient Earth processes and enhance our knowledge of the solar system in deep time.The geologic record of Milankovitch climate cycles provides a rich conceptual and temporal framework for evaluating Earth system evolution, bestowing a sharp lens through which to view our planet{\textquoteright}s history. However, the utility of these cycles for constraining the early Earth system is hindered by seemingly insurmountable uncertainties in our knowledge of solar system behavior (including Earth{\textendash}Moon history), and poor temporal control for validation of cycle periods (e.g., from radioisotopic dates). Here we address these problems using a Bayesian inversion approach to quantitatively link astronomical theory with geologic observation, allowing a reconstruction of Proterozoic astronomical cycles, fundamental frequencies of the solar system, the precession constant, and the underlying geologic timescale, directly from stratigraphic data. Application of the approach to 1.4-billion-year-old rhythmites indicates a precession constant of 85.79 {\textpm} 2.72 arcsec/year (2σ), an Earth{\textendash}Moon distance of 340,900 {\textpm} 2,600 km (2σ), and length of day of 18.68 {\textpm} 0.25 hours (2σ), with dominant climatic precession cycles of \~{}14 ky and eccentricity cycles of \~{}131 ky. The results confirm reduced tidal dissipation in the Proterozoic. A complementary analysis of Eocene rhythmites (\~{}55 Ma) illustrates how the approach offers a means to map out ancient solar system behavior and Earth{\textendash}Moon history using the geologic archive. The method also provides robust quantitative uncertainties on the eccentricity and climatic precession periods, and derived astronomical timescales. As a consequence, the temporal resolution of ancient Earth system processes is enhanced, and our knowledge of early solar system dynamics is greatly improved.},

In contrast, standard Solar models suggest the Sun was 25\% less luminous at this ancient epoch, implying a cold, frozen planet—all else kept equal. This discrepancy, known as the Faint Young Sun Paradox, remains unresolved. Most proposed solutions invoke high concentrations of greenhouse gases in the early atmosphere to offset for the fainter Sun, though current geological constraints are insufficient to verify or falsify these scenarios. In this work, we examined several simple mechanisms that involve the role played by Earth's spin rate, which was significantly faster during Archean time. This faster spin rate enhances the equator-to-pole temperature gradient, facilitating a warm equator, while maintaining cold poles. Results show that such an enhanced meridional gradient augments the meridional gradient in carbonate deposition, which biases the surviving geological record away from the global mean, toward warmer waters. Moreover, using simple atmospheric models, we found that the faster-spinning Earth was less sensitive to ice-albedo feedbacks, facilitating larger meridional temperature gradients before succumbing to global glaciation. We show that within the faster-spinning regime, the greenhouse warming required to generate an ice-free Earth can differ from that required to generate an Earth with permanent ice caps by the equivalent of 1–2 orders of magnitude of pCO2. Accordingly, the resolution of the Faint Young Sun problem depends significantly on whether the early Earth was ever, or even at times, ice-free."

Tyler (Tyler, R.H. [2008]. Nature 456, 770-772; Tyler, R.H. [2009]. Geophys. Res. Lett. 36, doi:10.1029/2009GL038300) suggested that obliquity tides could drive large-scale flow in the oceans of Europa and Enceladus, leading to significant heating. A critical unknown in this previous work is what the tidal quality factor, Q, of such an ocean should be. The corresponding tidal dissipation spans orders of magnitude depending on the value of Q assumed. To address this issue we adopt an approach employed in terrestrial ocean modeling, where a significant portion of tidal dissipation arises due to bottom drag, with the drag coefficient O (0.001) being relatively well-established. From numerical solutions to the shallow-water equations including nonlinear bottom drag, we obtain scalings for the equivalent value of Q as a function of this drag coefficient. In addition, we provide new scaling relations appropriate for the inclusion of ocean tidal heating in thermal–orbital evolution models. Our approach is appropriate for situations in which the ocean bottom topography is much smaller than the ocean thickness. Using these novel scalings, we calculate the ocean contribution to the overall thermal energy budgets for many of the outer Solar System satellites. Although uncertainties such as ocean thickness and satellite obliquity remain, we find that for most satellites it is unlikely that ocean tidal dissipation is important when compared to either radiogenic or solid-body tidal heating. Of known satellites, Triton is the most likely icy satellite to have ocean tidal heating play a role in its present day thermal budget and long-term thermal evolution."

	abstract = {HD 179070, aka Kepler-21, is a V = 8.25 F6IV star and the brightest exoplanet host discovered by Kepler. An early detailed analysis by Howell et al. of the first 13 months (Q0–Q5) of Kepler light curves revealed transits of a planetary companion, Kepler-21b, with a radius of about 1.60 ± 0.04  and an orbital period of about 2.7857 days. However, they could not determine the mass of the planet from the initial radial velocity (RV) observations with Keck-HIRES, and were only able to impose a 2σ upper limit of 10 . Here, we present results from the analysis of 82 new RV observations of this system obtained with HARPS-N, together with the existing 14 HIRES data points. We detect the Doppler signal of Kepler-21b with a RV semiamplitude K = 2.00 ± 0.65 , which corresponds to a planetary mass of 5.1 ± 1.7 . We also measure an improved radius for the planet of 1.639 +0.019/−0.015 , in agreement with the radius reported by Howell et al. We conclude that Kepler-21b, with a density of 6.4 ± 2.1 , belongs to the population of small, ≲6  planets with iron and magnesium silicate interiors, which have lost the majority of their envelope volatiles via stellar winds or gravitational escape. The RV analysis presented in this paper serves as an example of the type of analysis that will be necessary to confirm the masses of TESS small planet candidates.}

Considering that the planet rotation evolves under simultaneous actions of the torque due to the equatorial deformation and the tidal torque, both raised by the central star, we analyse the possibility of temporary captures in spin–orbit resonances.The results of the numerical simulations of the exact equations of motions indicate that, whenever the planet rotation is trapped in a resonant motion, the orbital decay and the eccentricity damping are faster than the ones in which the rotation follows the so-called pseudo-synchronization. Analytical results obtained through the averaged equations of the spin–orbit problem show a good agreement with the numerical simulations.We apply the analysis to the cases of the recently discovered hot super-Earths Kepler-10 b, GJ 3634 b and 55 Cnc e. The simulated dynamical history of these systems indicates the possibility of capture in several spin–orbit resonances; particularly, GJ 3634 b and 55 Cnc e can currently evolve under a non-synchronous resonant motion for suitable values of the parameters. Moreover, 55 Cnc e may avoid a chaotic rotation behaviour by evolving towards synchronization through successive temporary resonant trappings.}",

abstract = "The onset of the modern tectonic style that combines plate-related and plume-related mechanisms has been discussed. Such a tectonic style could have started on the Earth when all layers of our planet had formed. Analysis of available geological data shows that the solid inner core crystallized by 2.7 Ga. Typical geologic complexes appeared on the continents as a result of plate tectonics processes at that time. The layer D″ that accumulates lithospheric slabs, which do not remain at the upper-lower mantle interface but can go down to the core-mantle boundary, was finally produced by 2 Ga. At pressures and temperatures of the D″ layer perovskite, a principal mineral of the lower mantle transforms into postperovskite phase. The isotope data suggest the existence of mantle (EM-I and EM-II) domains, being the sources for oceanic island basalts (OIB) and the depleted upper mantle (asthenosphere), the source for mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB), from at least 2 Ga. It is accepted that the recent tectonic style started on the Earth at that period. Deep-seated processes suggest the involvement of all Earth’s layers. The asthenosphere–lithosphere interaction is responsible for different types of large surface structures that develop as fold mountains, oceanic spaces, and subduction zones. The descending lithospheric slabs (cold mantle material) and ascending mantle material in hot mantle provinces or the so-called low shear velocity provinces are responsible for the lower mantle convection. The plume is produced in the layer D″, which accumulates the descending lithosphere slabs as well as light elements released from the outer liquid core, which are oxidized in this layer, thus resulting in thermochemical plume formation. At the same time the molten ferric iron penetrates the core. So, we see the interaction of all Earth’s layers. The article also considers the evolutionary history of the Siberian continent over 700 Myr as early as the breakdown of Rodinia and the formation of mountain folds and rifting structures and the associated metallogeny."

abstract = "Although it is accepted that the significant eccentricity of Mercury (0.206) favours entrapment into the 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, open are the questions of how and when the capture took place. A recent work by Makarov (Makarov, V.V. [2012]. Astrophys. J., 752, 73) has proven that trapping into this state is certain for eccentricities larger than 0.2, provided we use a realistic tidal model based on the Darwin–Kaula expansion of the tidal torque. While in Ibid. a Mercury-like planet had its eccentricity fixed, we take into account its evolution. To that end, a family of possible histories of the eccentricity is generated, based on synthetic time evolution consistent with the expected statistics of the distribution of eccentricity. We employ a model of tidal friction, which takes into account both the rheology and self-gravitation of the planet. As opposed to the commonly used constant time lag (CTL) and constant phase lag (CPL) models, the physics-based tidal model changes dramatically the statistics of the possible final spin states. First, we discover that after only one encounter with the spin–orbit 3:2 resonance this resonance becomes the most probable end-state. Second, if a capture into this (or any other) resonance takes place, the capture becomes final, several crossings of the same state being forbidden by our model. Third, within our model the trapping of Mercury happens much faster than previously believed: for most histories, 10–20Myr are sufficient. Fourth, even a weak laminar friction between the solid mantle and a molten core would most likely result in a capture in the 2:1 or even higher resonance, which is confirmed both semi-analytically and by limited numerical simulations. So the principal novelty of our paper is that the 3:2 end-state is more ancient than the same end-state obtained when the constant time lag model is employed. The swift capture justifies our treatment of Mercury as a homogeneous, unstratified body whose liquid core had not yet formed by the time of trapping. We also provide a critical analysis of the hypothesis by Wieczorek et al. (Wieczorek, M.A., Correia, A.C.M., Le Feuvre, M., Laskar, J., Rambaux, N. [2012]. Nat. Geosci., 5, 18–21) that the early Mercury might had been retrograde, whereafter it synchronised its spin and then accelerated it to the 3:2 resonance. Accurate processing of the available data on cratering does not support that hypothesis, while the employment of a realistic rheology invalidates a key element of the hypothesis, an intermediate pseudosynchronous state needed to spin-up to the 3:2 resonance."

As initial conditions, we adopt the oligarchic growth regime of protoplanets in a disc where several embryos are allowed to form. We take different initial planetary system parameters and for each initial condition, we consider an evolution of 2 × 107 yr of the system. We perform simulations for 1000 different discs, and from their results we derive the statistical properties of the assembled planets. We have taken special attention to the planetary obliquities and rotation periods, such as the information obtained from the mass and semimajor axis diagram, which reflects the process of planetary formation. The distribution of obliquities was found to be isotropic, which means that planets can rotate in direct or indirect sense, regardless of their mass. Our results regarding the primordial rotation periods show that they are dependent on the region where the embryo was formed and evolved. According to our results, most of the planets have rotation periods between 10 and 10 000 h and there are also a large population of planets similar to terrestrial planets in the Solar system.}",

Such semiliquid bodies may or may not have rigid crusts with permanent figures. Unlike planets with solid mantles and Earth-like rheology, semiliquid bodies can be captured into stable pseudosynchronous spin resonance, where the average rate of rotation is higher than the synchronous 1:1 resonance. Two basic conditions are derived for capture of planets with a triaxial figure into pseudosynchronous rotation, one related to the characteristic tidal wave number (the product of the tidal frequency by the Maxwell time), and the other to the orbital eccentricity. If a semiliquid object does not satisfy either of the two conditions, it is captured into the synchronous resonance. For nearly axially symmetric bodies, only the first condition is in place, and the other is much relaxed, so they should predominantly be pseudosynchronous. It is also pointed out that the equilibrium pseudosychronous rotation rate can not reach the widely used asymptotic value from the constant time lag model but is in reality closer to the synchronous spin.}

abstract = {The perturbing potential due to the tidal interaction between the earth, sun, and moon is obtained without restrictive assumptions on the internal constitution of the earth. The derived potential is used in Gauss's equations for the time rate of change of the eccentricity, semimajor axis, and inclination of the moon's orbit. The tidal forces perturb the elements describing the earth's motion about the sun by a negligibly small amount. The variation in the earth's angular momentum due to the solar and lunar tides is described by Euler's equations. It is assumed that the moment of inertia of the earth corresponds to that appropriate for a rotating fluid with the density distribution of the present earth. The rate of change of the moon's orbital elements is determined by the phase lag in the elastic component of the tidal bulge raised by the sun and moon. Astronomical data give a current value of the lag of the lunar tidal bulge of 2.16°. The present phase lag corresponds to a rate of increase of the semimajor axis of 3.2 cm yr−1, a rate of decrease of the inclination of the moon's orbital plane of 9.35 × 10−12 rad yr−1, and a rate of increase in the eccentricity of 1.2 × 10−10 yr−1. The obliquity of the earth's equator to the ecliptic and the period of rotation are increasing at present, owing to the combined effects of the lunar and solar tides. The effects of the solar tides are small at present but become important in the future. Numerical integrations of the coupled Gauss-Euler equations are used to describe both the past history and the future evolution of the earth-moon system. If the moon traveled a circular orbit, a backward tracing of the history shows the moon approaching the earth, reaching a minimum distance of 2.72 present earth radii. During the time of closest approach, the inclination and obliquity change rapidly, with the moon's orbital plane passing over the pole and the moon's motion becoming retrograde. If the orbit is eccentric, the eccentricity increases rapidly at the time of close approach. The perigee height remains nearly constant, while the apogee increases without bounds over a time of about 1000 years. If the current phase lag remains constant, the time of closest approach is only 1.78 × 109 years ago. Thus, the current phase lag is not consistent with the hypothesis that the earth-moon system has existed throughout geologic time. The rotational parameters of Mars, Venus, and Mercury are discussed in terms of the dynamical theory. The distribution of rotational angular momentum of the solar system is described, and it is proposed that the major planets and Mars have lost only a very small proportion of their initial rotational angular momentum. The observed dependence of rotational angular momentum on planetary mass yields an estimate of the initial rotational period of the earth of between 9 and 13 hours. The mechanisms by which the earth's rotational energy can be dissipated are reviewed. It is argued that the phase lag in the tides may have remained constant over geologic time or may have been somewhat larger. This conclusion raises the problem of the age of the earth-moon system. Theories of the origin of the moon are discussed against the requirements imposed by dynamical considerations. It is concluded that the theories of the fission of the earth to form the moon must be discarded, because the moon, once placed in the equatorial orbit, would remain there. Dynamics places severe constraints on the initial conditions for either a capture origin or the development of a binary system. The theory of several initial moons is briefly described, as are the climatological and tectonic problems raised by the consideration of the past history of the earth-moon system.},

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Identifying terrestrial planets in the habitable zones (HZs) of other stars is one of the primary goals of ongoing radial velocity (RV) and transit exoplanet surveys and proposed future space missions. Most current estimates of the boundaries of the HZ are based on one-dimensional (1D), cloud-free, climate model calculations by Kasting et al. However, this model used band models that were based on older HITRAN and HITEMP line-by-line databases. The inner edge of the HZ in the Kasting et al. model was determined by loss of water, and the outer edge was determined by the maximum greenhouse provided by a CO2 atmosphere. A conservative estimate for the width of the HZ from this model in our solar system is 0.95-1.67 AU. Here an updated 1D radiative-convective, cloud-free climate model is used to obtain new estimates for HZ widths around F, G, K, and M stars. New H2O and CO2 absorption coefficients, derived from the HITRAN 2008 and HITEMP 2010 line-by-line databases, are important improvements to the climate model. According to the new model, the water-loss (inner HZ) and maximum greenhouse (outer HZ) limits for our solar system are at 0.99 and 1.70 AU, respectively, suggesting that the present Earth lies near the inner edge. Additional calculations are performed for stars with effective temperatures between 2600 and 7200 K, and the results are presented in parametric form, making them easy to apply to actual stars. The new model indicates that, near the inner edge of the HZ, there is no clear distinction between runaway greenhouse and water-loss limits for stars with T
            eff ≲ 5000 K, which has implications for ongoing planet searches around K and M stars. To assess the potential habitability of extrasolar terrestrial planets, we propose using stellar flux incident on a planet rather than equilibrium temperature. This removes the dependence on planetary (Bond) albedo, which varies depending on the host star's spectral type. We suggest that conservative estimates of the HZ (water-loss and maximum greenhouse limits) should be used for current RV surveys and Kepler mission to obtain a lower limit on η⊕, so that future flagship missions like TPF-C and Darwin are not undersized. Our model does not include the radiative effects of clouds; thus, the actual HZ boundaries may extend further in both directions than the estimates just given.}

	abstract = {The ongoing discoveries of extra-solar planets are unveiling a wide range of terrestrial mass (size) planets around their host stars. In this Letter, we present estimates of habitable zones (HZs) around stars with stellar effective temperatures in the range 2600 K–7200 K, for planetary masses between 0.1 M⊕ and 5 M⊕. Assuming H2O-(inner HZ) and CO2-(outer HZ) dominated atmospheres, and scaling the background N2 atmospheric pressure with the radius of the planet, our results indicate that larger planets have wider HZs than do smaller ones. Specifically, with the assumption that smaller planets will have less dense atmospheres, the inner edge of the HZ (runaway greenhouse limit) moves outward (∼10% lower than Earth flux) for low mass planets due to larger greenhouse effect arising from the increased H2O column depth. For larger planets, the H2O column depth is smaller, and higher temperatures are needed before water vapor completely dominates the outgoing longwave radiation. Hence the inner edge moves inward (∼7% higher than Earth's flux). The outer HZ changes little due to the competing effects of the greenhouse effect and an increase in albedo. New, three-dimensional climate model results from other groups are also summarized, and we argue that further, independent studies are needed to verify their predictions. Combined with our previous work, the results presented here provide refined estimates of HZs around main-sequence stars and provide a step toward a more comprehensive analysis of HZs.}

Some exoplanets very close to their stars aren{\textquoteright}t so lucky and are generally assumed to be locked by tides into hemispheres of unchanging day and night. The thick atmosphere of Venus is thought to keep it from the same fate, but Leconte et al. present models showing that even a much sparser atmosphere may suffice for lower-mass stars. The non-instantaneous thermal response of the planet (when the hottest time of day is after noon) may speed up or slow down the planet. Such thermal tides may be important in assessing potential extraterrestrial habitable zones.Science, this issue p. 632 Planets in the habitable zone of lower-mass stars are often assumed to be in a state of tidally synchronized rotation, which would considerably affect their putative habitability. Although thermal tides cause Venus to rotate retrogradely, simple scaling arguments tend to attribute this peculiarity to the massive Venusian atmosphere. Using a global climate model, we show that even a relatively thin atmosphere can drive terrestrial planets{\textquoteright} rotation away from synchronicity. We derive a more realistic atmospheric tide model that predicts four asynchronous equilibrium spin states, two being stable, when the amplitude of the thermal tide exceeds a threshold that is met for habitable Earth-like planets with a 1-bar atmosphere around stars more massive than ~0.5 to 0.7 solar mass. Thus, many recently discovered terrestrial planets could exhibit asynchronous spin-orbit rotation, even with a thin atmosphere.},

Since the planet’s discovery in 2008, the time interval between transits has been decreasing by 29 ± 2 ms yr−1. This is a possible sign of orbital decay, although the previously available data left open the possibility that the planet’s orbit is slightly eccentric and is undergoing apsidal precession. Here, we present new transit and occultation observations that provide more decisive evidence for orbital decay, which is favored over apsidal precession by a  of 22.3 or Bayes factor of 70,000. We also present new radial-velocity data that rule out the Rømer effect as the cause of the period change. This makes WASP-12 the first planetary system for which we can be confident that the orbit is decaying. The decay timescale for the orbit is .

	abstract = {We study the thermal evolution of super-Earths with a one-dimensional (1D) parameterized convection model that has been adopted to account for a strong pressure dependence of the viscosity. A comparison with a 2D spherical convection model shows that the derived parameterization satisfactorily represents the main characteristics of the thermal evolution of massive rocky planets. We find that the pressure dependence of the viscosity strongly influences the thermal evolution of super-Earths—resulting in a highly sluggish convection regime in the lower mantles of those planets. Depending on the effective activation volume and for cooler initial conditions, we observe with growing planetary mass even the formation of a conductive lid above the core-mantle boundary (CMB), a so-called CMB-lid. For initially molten planets our results suggest no CMB-lids but instead a hot lower mantle and core as well as sluggish lower mantle convection. This implies that the initial interior temperatures, especially in the lower mantle, become crucial for the thermal evolution—the thermostat effect suggested to regulate the interior temperatures in terrestrial planets does not work for massive planets if the viscosity is strongly pressure dependent. The sluggish convection and the potential formation of the CMB-lid reduce the convective vigor throughout the mantle, thereby affecting convective stresses, lithospheric thicknesses, and heat fluxes. The pressure dependence of the viscosity may therefore also strongly affect the propensity of plate tectonics, volcanic activity, and the generation of a magnetic field of super-Earths.}

abstract = "The subsolidus convective cooling histories of terrestrial planets evolving from hot initial states are investigated with a simple analytic model which simulates the average heat transport in a vigorously convecting mantle devoid of internal heat sources. The temperature dependence of the effective viscosity of mantle rocks is the single most important factor controlling thermal history. It is responsible for the growth of the rigid lithosphere, a rheological and thermal boundary layer, and serves the function of a thermostat, regulating the rate of cooling by the negative feedback between viscosity and temperature. Except for a relatively short period of time when mantle temperature decreases rapidly during the early stages of cooling, a planet cools mainly by thickening its lithosphere; the underlying mantle temperature decreases relatively slowly. On one-plate planets, the growth of a rigid lithosphere involves an imbalance between the surface heat flux and the heat flow from the mantle; the former is always larger than the latter. Primordial heat can contribute substantially, e.g., as much as about a fourth or a third, to the present surface heat flux of a planet. For both these reasons, the radiogenic heat source content of a planet is likely to be overestimated by inferences from surface heat flow observations."

abstract = {The consequences of an early epoch of plate tectonics on Mars followed by single-plate tectonics with stagnant lid mantle convection on both crust production and magnetic field generation have been studied with parameterized mantle convection models. Thermal history models with parameterized mantle convection, not being dynamo models, can provide necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for dynamo action. It is difficult to find early plate tectonics models that can reasonably explain crust formation, as is required by geological and geophysical observations, and allow an early magnetic field that is widely accepted as the cause for the observed magnetic anomalies. Dating of crust provinces and topography and gravity data suggest a crust production rate monotonically declining through the Noachian and Hesperian and a present-day crust thickness of more than 50 km. Plate tectonics cools the mantle and core efficiently, and the core may easily generate an early magnetic field. Given a sufficiently weak mantle rheology, plate tectonics can explain a field even if the core is not initially superheated with respect to the mantle. Because the crust production rate is proportional to temperature, however, an early efficient cooling will frustrate later crust production and therefore cannot explain, for example, the absence of prominent magnetic anomalies in the northern crustal province and the northern volcanic plains in the Early Hesperian. Voluminous crust formation following plate tectonics is possible if plate tectonics heat transfer is inefficient but then the crust growth rate has a late peak (about 2 Ga b.p.), which is not observed. These models also require a substantial initial superheating of the core to allow a dynamo. If one accepts the initial superheating, then, as we will show, a simple thermal evolution model with monotonic cooling of the planet due to stagnant lid mantle convection underneath a single plate throughout the evolution can better reconcile early crust formation and magnetic field generation.},

abstract = {The rheology of the Martian mantle and the planet's initial temperature is constrained with thermal evolution models that include crust growth and test the conditions for magnetic field generation in the core. As observations we use the present-day average crustal thickness of 50–120km as estimated from the Mars Global Surveyor gravity and topography data, the evidence for the crust being produced mostly early, with a rate declining from the Noachian to the Hesperian, and the evidence for an early magnetic field that likely existed for less than a billion years. We use the fact that the rate of crust growth is a function of temperature, which must be above the solidus in the sub-lithosphere mantle, and the mantle convection speed because the latter determines the rate at which melt can be replenished. The convection speed is a strong function of viscosity which, in turn, is a strong function of temperature and also of the water content of the mantle. We use a viscosity parameterization with a reference viscosity evaluated at 1600K the value of which can be characteristic of either a dry or a wet mantle. We further consider the Fe–FeS phase diagram for the core and compare the core liquidus estimated for a sulphur content of $14 \%$ as suggested by the SNC meteorite compositions with the core temperatures calculated for our cooling models. Two data sets of the Fe–FeS eutectic temperature have been used that differ by about 200K [Böhler, R., 1996. Fe–FeS eutectic temperatures at 620kbar. Phys. Earth Planet. Inter. 96, 181–186; Fei, Y., Bertka, C.M., Finger, L.W., 1997. High-pressure iron–sulphur compound, Fe3S2, and melting relations in the Fe–FeS system. Science 275, 1621–1623] at Martian core–mantle boundary pressure and in the eutectic composition by $5 \text{wt}\%$. The differences in eutectic temperature and composition translate into a difference of about 400K in liquidus temperature for $14 \, \text{wt} \%$ sulphur. We find it premature to rule out specific mantle rheologies on the basis of the presently available crustal thickness and crust growth evidence. Rather a trade-off exists between the initial mantle temperature and the reference viscosity. Both a wet mantle rheology with a reference viscosity less than 1020Pas and a dry mantle rheology with a reference viscosity of 1021Pas or more can be acceptable if initial mantle temperatures between roughly 1700 and 2000K are allowed. To explain the magnetic field history, the differences in liquidus temperatures matter. For a liquidus temperature of about 1900K at the Martian core–mantle boundary as calculated from the Böhler et al. eutectic, a dry mantle rheology can best explain the lack of a present-day dynamo. For a liquidus temperature of about 1500K at the core–mantle boundary as calculated from the Fei et al. eutectic all models are consistent with the observed lack of dynamo action. The reason lies with the fact that at$14 \, \text{wt} \%$S the Martian core would be close to the eutectic composition if the Fei et al. data are correct. As inner core growth is unlikely for an almost eutectic core, the early field would have been generated by a thermally driven dynamo. Together with the measured strength of the Martian crustal magnetization this would prove the feasibility of a strong thermally driven dynamo.}

	abstract = {M-type stars are good targets in the search for habitable extrasolar planets. Due to their low effective temperatures, the habitable zone of M stars is very close to the stars themselves. For planets that are close to their stars, tidal heating plays an important role in thermal and orbital evolutions, especially when the planet's orbit has a relatively large eccentricity. Although tidal heating interacts with the thermal state and the orbit of the planet, such coupled calculations for extrasolar planets around M stars have not been conducted. We perform coupled calculations using simple structural and orbital models and analyze the thermal state and habitability of a terrestrial planet. Considering this planet to be Martian-sized, the tide heats up and partially melts the mantle, maintaining an equilibrium state if the mass of the star is less than 0.2 times the mass of the Sun and the initial eccentricity of the orbit is more than 0.2. The reduction of heat dissipation due to the melted mantle allows the planet to stay in the habitable zone for more than 10 Gyr even though the orbital distance is small. The surface heat flux at the equilibrium state is between that of Mars and Io. The thermal state of the planet mainly depends on the initial value of the eccentricity and the mass of the star.}

	abstract = {Tidal friction in exoplanet systems, driven by orbits that allow for durable nonzero eccentricities at short heliocentric periods, can generate internal heating far in excess of the conditions observed in our own solar system. Secular perturbations or a notional 2:1 resonance between a hot Earth and hot Jupiter can be used as a baseline to consider the thermal evolution of convecting bodies subject to strong viscoelastic tidal heating. We compare results first from simple models using a fixed Quality factor and Love number, and then for three different viscoelastic rheologies: the Maxwell body, the Standard Anelastic Solid (SAS), and the Burgers body. The SAS and Burgers models are shown to alter the potential for extreme tidal heating by introducing the possibility of new equilibria and multiple response peaks. We find that tidal heating tends to exceed radionuclide heating at periods below 10-30 days, and exceed insolation only below 1-2 days. Extreme cases produce enough tidal heat to initiate global-scale partial melting, and an analysis of tidal limiting mechanisms such as advective cooling for earthlike planets is discussed. To explore long-term behaviors, we map equilibria points between convective heat loss and tidal heat input as functions of eccentricity. For the periods and magnitudes discussed, we show that tidal heating, if significant, is generally detrimental to the width of habitable zones.}

Particular attention is paid to ice-silicate hybrid super-Earths, where a significant ice mantle is modeled to rest atop an iron-silicate core, and may or may not contain a liquid water ocean. We find multilayer modeling often increases tidal dissipation relative to a homogeneous model, across multiple orbital periods, due to the ability to include smaller volume low viscosity regions, and the added flexure allowed by liquid layers. Gradations in parameters with depth are explored, such as allowed by the Preliminary Earth Reference Model. For ice-silicate hybrid worlds, dramatically greater dissipation is possible beyond the case of a silicate mantle only, allowing non-negligible tidal activity to extend to greater orbital periods than previously predicted. Surface patterns of tidal heating are found to potentially be useful for distinguishing internal structure. The influence of ice mantle depth and water ocean size and position are shown for a range of forcing frequencies. Rates of orbital circularization are found to be 10-100 times faster than standard predictions for Earth-analog planets when interiors are moderately warmer than the modern Earth, as well as for a diverse range of ice-silicate hybrid super-Earths. Circularization rates are shown to be significantly longer for planets with layers equivalent to an ocean-free modern Earth, as well as for planets with high fractions of either ice or silicate melting.}

abstract = "Thermal evolution models for the terrestrial planets Mars, Mercury, and Venus with core and mantle chemical differentiation, lithosphere growth, and volcanic heat transfer have been calculated. The mantle differentiates by forming a crust and the core differentiates by inner core solidification. Continued volcanic activity for billions-of-years is found to be possible even on small terrestrial planets if crust growth is limited by lithosphere growth during the early evolution. Later, crust formation may be limited by the declining vigor of mantle convection. The thicknesses of the crust and lithosphere are found to depend mainly on planet size, on the bulk concentration of radiogenic elements in the planet, and on the ratio between volcanic and conductive heat transfer through the lithosphere. Two end-member models have been calculated and the concentration of radiogenics in the planet has been varied. In the first model, heat transfer from the mantle to the surface occurs via heat conduction through the lithosphere, while in the second model, mantle heat is advected via volcanic vents. Geologic evidence for volcanism on Mars and Mercury for at least 3.5 Ga and up to 1 Ga, respectively, the absence of a magnetic field on Mars, and the presence of such a field on Mercury suggest that heat transfer in these planets was dominated by heat conduction through the lithosphere for most of their thermal history. The present crust of Mercury is estimated to be a few tens of kilometers thick and about 10% of the mantle initial inventory of heat sources is fractionated into the crust. The Martian crust may be 50–100 km thick, possibly constituting more than a third of the lithosphere. Volcanic heat piping may have been an important heat transfer mechanism on Venus and volcanic activity may continue to the present day. Venus may have a crust that may constitute almost the entire lithosphere but crustal thickness may be limited by the basalt-eclogite phase transformation to 60 to 80 km. It is estimated that the present mantles of Mars and Venus are similarly depleted of about 20 to 40% of their initial heat source inventory."

abstract = {Over the past decade the analysis of sedimentary cyclic rhythmites of tidal origin, i.e., stacked thin beds or laminae usually of sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone that display periodic variations in thickness reflecting a strong tidal influence on sedimentation, has provided information on Earth's paleorotation and the evolving lunar orbit for Precambrian time (before 540 Ma). Depositional environments of tidal rhythmites range from estuarine to tidal delta, with a wave-protected, distal ebb tidal delta setting being particularly favorable for the deposition and preservation of long, detailed rhythmite records. The potential sediment load of nearshore tidal currents and the effectiveness of the tide as an agent of sediment entrainment and deposition are related directly to tidal range (or maximum tidal height) and consequent current speed. Hence the thickness of successive laminae deposited by tidal currents can be a proxy tidal record, with paleotidal and paleorotational values being determined by analysis of measured records of lamina and cycle thickness. The validity of the findings can be investigated by testing the primary, observed values for internal self-consistency through application of the laws of celestial mechanics. Paleotidal and paleorotational values provided by late Neoproterozoic (∼620 Ma) tidal rhythmites in South Australia are validated by these tests and indicate 13.1±0.1 synodic (lunar) months/yr, 400±7 solar days/yr, a length of day of 21.9±0.4 h, and a relative Earth-Moon distance a/a0 of 0.965±0.005. The mean rate of lunar recession since that time is 2.17±0.31 cm/yr, which is little more than half the present rate of lunar recession of 3.82±0.07 cm/yr obtained by lunar laser ranging. The late Neoproterozoic data militate against significant overall change in Earth's moment of inertia and radius at least since 620 Ma. Cyclicity displayed by Paleoproterozoic (2450 Ma) banded iron formation in Western Australia may record tidal influences on the discharge and/or dispersal of submarine hydrothermal plumes and suggests 14.5±0.5 synodic months/yr and a/a0 = 0.906±0.029. The combined rhythmite data give a mean rate of lunar recession of 1.24±0.71 cm/yr during most of the Proterozoic (2450–620 Ma), suggesting that a close approach of the Moon did not occur during earlier time. Concentrated study of Precambrian tidal rhythmites promises to illuminate the evolving dynamics of the early Earth-Moon system and may permit the lunar orbit to be traced back to near the time of the Moon's origin.},

abstract={The study of tides from the sedimentary record of tidal rhythmites, applying fast Fourier transform analysis, contributes to the understanding of the surficial evolution of our highly dynamic planet, and of the astronomical cycles that influenced the ancient tidal systems. This overview of lunar retreat rates, which includes examples from Argentina, displays a generalized pattern of nonlinear, progressively extended lunar cycles up to the present day. The lunar retreat calculated at different stages of the Earth{\^a}??s history identifies three time spans of extremely high recession rates, amounting to almost twice that of the present day: Archean{\^a}??Paleoproterozoic (6.93 cm/year), Neoproterozoic I{\^a}??Ediacaran (7.01 cm/year) and Ediacaran{\^a}??early Cambrian (6.48 cm/year). Older comparable recession rates are difficult to recognize because of the lack of tidal rhythmic sequences. The maximum lunar retreat rate is registered after the Copernican meteor bombardment event on the Moon at {\textasciitilde}900 Ma, and the time span coincides with the continental dispersal of Rodinia. Every acceleration of the lunar retreat rate coincides with two main processes: (1) meteorite impacts on the Earth or Moon, and (2) reconfiguration of landmasses accompanied by earthquakes that generated changes in the rotational axis of the Earth, inundation surfaces, and glaciation/deglaciation processes. The simultaneous occurrence of such processes makes it difficult to distinguish the causes and effects of each individual process, but its conjunction would have promoted the destabilization of the Earth{\^a}??Moon system in terms of moment of inertia that was transferred to the Moon rotation.},

A phase of rapid lithospheric growth is observed during the Hesperian and we propose that this elastic thickness history is a consequence of the martian crustal rheology and its thermal evolution. A wet crustal rheology is found to generate a mechanically incompetent layer in the lower crust during the early evolution and the rapid growth of Te during the Hesperian results from the disappearance of this layer due to planetary cooling. The incompetent layer and the related rapid lithospheric growth are absent for a dry basaltic crustal rheology, which is therefore incompatible with the observations. Furthermore, we find that the observed elastic thickness evolution is best compatible with a wet mantle rheology, although a dry mantle cannot be ruled out. It therefore seems likely that rheologically significant amounts of water were retained in the Martian crust and mantle after planetary accretion."

abstract = "Results of about 100 hydrodynamic simulations of potential Moon-forming impacts are presented, focusing on the “late impact” scenario in which the lunar forming impact occurs near the very end of Earth's accretion (Canup and Asphaug, 2001, Nature 412, 708–712). A new equation of state is utilized that includes a treatment of molecular vapor (“M-ANEOS”; Melosh, 2000, in: Proc. Lunar Planet. Sci. Conf. 31st, p. 1903). The sensitivity of impact outcome to collision conditions is assessed, in particular how the mass, angular momentum, composition and origin (target vs. impactor) of the material placed into circumterrestrial orbit vary with impact angle, speed, impactor-to-target mass ratio, and initial thermal state of the colliding objects. The most favorable conditions for producing a sufficiently massive and iron-depleted protolunar disk involve collisions with an impact angle near 45 degrees and an impactor velocity at infinity <4 km/sec. For a total mass and angular momentum near to that of the current Earth–Moon system, such impacts typically place about a lunar mass of material into orbits exterior to the Roche limit, with the orbiting material composed of 10 to 30% vapor by mass. In all cases, the vast majority of the orbiting material originates from the impactor, consistent with previous findings. By mapping the end fate (escaping, orbiting, or in the planet) of each particle and the peak temperature it experiences during the impact onto the figure of the initial objects, it is shown that in the successful collisions, the impactor material that ends up in orbit is primarily that portion of the object that was heated the least, having avoided direct collision with the Earth. Using these and previous results as a guide, a continuous suite of impact conditions intermediate to the “late impact” (Canup and Asphaug, 2001, Nature 412, 708–712) and “early Earth” (Cameron, 2000, in: Canup, R.M., Righter, K.

abstract = {The giant impact theory is the leading hypothesis for the origin of the Moon. This review focuses on dynamical aspects of an impact-induced lunar formation, in particular those areas that have advanced considerably in the past decade, including (a) late-stage terrestrial accretion, (b) giant impact simulations, (c) protolunar disk evolution and lunar accretion, and (d) the origin of the initial lunar inclination. In all, recent developments now provide a reasonably consistent dynamical account of the origin of the Moon through a late giant impact with Earth, and suggest that the impact-generation of satellites is likely to be a common process in late-stage solid planet formation.}

abstract = {Prior models of lunar-forming impacts assume that both the impactor and the target protoearth were not rotating prior to the Moon-forming event. However, planet formation models suggest that such objects would have been rotating rapidly during the late stages of terrestrial accretion. In this paper I explore the effects of pre-impact rotation on impact outcomes through more than 100 hydrodynamical simulations that consider a range of impactor masses, impact angles and impact speeds. Pre-impact rotation, particularly in the target protoearth, can substantially alter collisional outcomes and leads to a more diverse set of final planet–disk systems than seen previously. However, the subset of these impacts that are also lunar-forming candidates—i.e. that produce a sufficiently massive and iron-depleted protolunar disk—have properties similar to those determined for collisions of non-rotating objects [Canup, R.M., Asphaug, E., 2001. Nature 412, 708–712; Canup, R.M., 2004a. Icarus 168, 433–456]. With or without pre-impact rotation, a lunar-forming impact requires an impact angle near 45 degrees, together with a low impact velocity that is not more than 10% larger than the Earth's escape velocity, and produces a disk containing up to about two lunar masses that is composed predominantly of material originating from the impactor. The most significant differences in the successful cases involving pre-impact spin occur for impacts into a retrograde rotating protoearth, which allow for larger impactors (containing up to 20% of Earth's mass) and provide an improved match with the current Earth–Moon system angular momentum compared to prior results. The most difficult state to reconcile with the Moon is that of a rapidly spinning, low-obliquity protoearth before the giant impact, as these cases produce disks that are not massive enough to yield the Moon.}

	journal = {The Planetary Science Journal},
	abstract = {Using the Andrade-derived Sundberg–Cooper rheology, we apply several improvements to the secular tidal evolution of TRAPPIST-1e and the early history of Pluto–Charon under the simplifying assumption of homogeneous bodies. By including higher-order eccentricity terms (up to and including e20), we find divergences from the traditionally used e2 truncation starting around e = 0.1. Order-of-magnitude differences begin to occur for e > 0.6. Critically, higher-order eccentricity terms activate additional spin–orbit resonances. Worlds experiencing nonsynchronous rotation can fall into and out of these resonances, altering their long-term evolution. Nonzero obliquity generally does not generate significantly higher heating; however, it can considerably alter orbital and rotational evolution. Much like eccentricity, obliquity can activate new tidal modes and resonances. Tracking the dual-body dissipation within Pluto and Charon leads to faster evolution and dramatically different orbital outcomes. Based on our findings, we recommend future tidal studies on worlds with e ≥ 0.3 to take into account additional eccentricity terms beyond e2. This threshold should be lowered to e > 0.1 if nonsynchronous rotation or nonzero obliquity is under consideration. Due to the poor convergence of the eccentricity functions, studies on worlds that may experience very high eccentricity (e ≥ 0.6) should include terms with high powers of eccentricity. We provide these equations up to e10 for arbitrary obliquity and nonsynchronous rotation. Finally, the assumption that short-period, solid-body exoplanets with e ≳ 0.1 are tidally locked in their 1:1 spin–orbit resonance should be reconsidered. Higher-order spin–orbit resonances can exist even at these relatively modest eccentricities, while previous studies have found such resonances can significantly alter stellar-driven climate.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {The thermal, orbital, and rotational dynamics of tidally loaded exoplanets are interconnected by intricate feedback. The rheological structure of the planet determines its susceptibility to tidal deformation and, as a consequence, participates in shaping its orbit. The orbital parameters and the spin state, conversely, control the rate of tidal dissipation and may lead to substantial changes in the interior. We investigate the coupled thermal–orbital evolution of differentiated rocky exoplanets governed by the Andrade viscoelastic rheology. The coupled evolution is treated by a semianalytical model, 1D parameterized heat transfer, and self-consistently calculated tidal dissipation. First, we conduct several parametric studies, exploring the effect of the rheological properties, the planet size, and the orbital eccentricity on tidal locking and dissipation. These tests show that the role of tidal locking into high spin–orbit resonances is most prominent on low eccentric orbits, where it results in substantially higher tidal heating than synchronous rotation. Second, we calculate the long-term evolution of three currently known low-mass exoplanets with nonzero orbital eccentricity and absent or yet-unknown eccentricity forcing (namely GJ 625 b, GJ 411 b, and Proxima Centauri b). The tidal model incorporates the formation of a stable magma ocean and a consistently evolving spin rate. We find that the thermal state is strongly affected by the evolution of eccentricity and spin state and proceeds as a sequence of thermal equilibria. Final despinning into synchronous rotation slows down the orbital evolution and helps to maintain long-term stable orbital eccentricity.}

journal={Nature Astronomy},
year={2021},
month={Feb},
day={22},
abstract={The origin of the Martian moons, Phobos and Deimos, remains elusive. While the morphology and their cratered surfaces suggest an asteroidal origin, capture has been questioned because of potential dynamical difficulties in achieving the current near-circular, near-equatorial orbits4,5. To circumvent this, in situ formation models have been proposed as alternatives. Yet, explaining the present location of the moons on opposite sides of the synchronous radius, their small sizes and apparent compositional differences with Mars2 has proved challenging. Here, we combine geophysical and tidal-evolution modelling of a Mars--satellite system to propose that Phobos and Deimos originated from disintegration of a common progenitor that was possibly formed in situ. We show that tidal dissipation within a Mars--satellite system, enhanced by the physical libration of the satellite, circularizes the post-disrupted eccentric orbits in $<2.7{\thinspace}$ Gyr and makes Phobos descend to its present orbit from its point of origin close to or above the synchronous orbit. Our estimate for Phobos's maximal tidal lifetime is considerably less than the age of Mars, indicating that it is unlikely to have originated alongside Mars. Deimos initially moved inwards, but never transcended the co-rotation radius because of insufficient eccentricity and therefore insufficient tidal dissipation. Whereas Deimos is very slowly receding from Mars, Phobos will continue to spiral towards and either impact with Mars or become tidally disrupted on reaching the Roche limit in $\apprle 39{\thinspace}$ Myr.},

abstract = {Several new scenarios of the Moon-forming giant impact have been proposed to reconcile the giant impact theory with the recent recognition of the volatile and refractory isotopic similarities between Moon and Earth. Two scenarios leave the post-impact Earth spinning much faster than what is inferred from the present Earth-Moon system's angular momentum. The evection resonance has been proposed to drain the excess angular momentum, but the lunar orbit stays at high orbital eccentricities for long periods in the resonance, which would cause large tidal heating in the Moon. A limit cycle related to the evection resonance has also been suggested as an alternative mechanism to reduce the angular momentum, which keeps the lunar orbit at much lower eccentricities, and operates in a wider range of parameters. In this study we use a coupled thermal-orbital model to determine the effect of the change of the Moon's thermal state on the Earth-Moon system's dynamical history. The evection resonance no longer drains angular momentum from the Earth-Moon system since the system rapidly exits the resonance. Whereas the limit cycle works robustly to drain as much angular momentum as in the non-thermally-coupled model, though the Moon's tidal properties change throughout the evolution.}

They found a narrow range of parameters that gave results consistent with the current angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system. However, a tidal model was used that was described as approximating a constant Q tidal model, but it was not a constant Q model. Here we use a conventional constant Q tidal model to explore the process. We find that there is still a narrow range of parameters in which angular momentum is withdrawn from the system that corresponds roughly to the range found earlier, but the final angular momentum is too low to be consistent with the Earth–Moon system. Exploring a broader range of parameters we find a new phenomenon, not found in the earlier work, that extracts angular momentum from the Earth–Moon system over a broader range of parameters. The final angular momentum is more consistent with the actual angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system. We develop a simple model that exhibits the phenomenon.}

abstract = {We present results of a study of the 53Mn-53Cr systematics in various solar system objects: angrites, eucrites, chondrites, diogenites, pallasites, the Earth and the Moon, and SNC meteorites. The primary goal of this study was to explore the capabilities of the 53Mn-53Cr isotope system as a chronometer and as a tracer for events in the early solar system, to obtain chronological information on different classes of meteorites, and to investigate the indigenous distribution of 53Mn in the late nebula. These studies have shown that all meteorite groups investigated so far have excess 53Cr relative to the terrestrial value. A lunar sample exhibits 53Cr/52Cr ratios which are the same as the terrestrial normal. The angrites, several eucrites, and the pallasites show clear evidence for the existence of life 53Mn during their formation while other meteorites were isotopically equilibrated after essentially all 53Mn had decayed. A well defined whole-rock 53Mn-53Cr isochron for the HED (Howardite-Eucrite-Diogenite) parent body was obtained. The isochron indicates that this planetesimal was essentially totally molten and differentiated ∼7 Ma before the angrites crystallized. Using the absolute age of the angrites as a time marker this event has occurred 4565 Ma ago, within present uncertainties at the same time when high temperature meteorite inclusions (CAI) were formed in the nebula. The first basalts were deposited onto its surface within less than 3 Ma. The bulk Mn/Cr ratios of the HED parent body (presumably Vesta), the angrites, and the pallasites are consistent with a chondritic Mn/Cr ratio. The results from the SCN meteorites show that their 53Cr excesses are less than half of those found in the other meteorites. Thus, the characteristic 53Cr/52Cr ratio of Mars (assuming SNCs originate from this planet) are intermediate between that of the earth-moon system and those of the other meteorites. When these 53Cr excesses are plotted as a function of the heliocentric distance of the place of origin of the samples then a linear relationship is indicated. Provided that this variation is due to the decay of 53Mn then a radial heterogeneous distribution of 53Mn must have existed in at least the inner early solar system. It is argued that radial fractionation within the nebula, based on the slightly higher volatility of Mn as compared to that of Cr, is an unlikely cause for this distribution. Thus, it must be an intrinsic feature of the late solar nebula. Stochastic mixing processes at the planetary embryo stage did obviously not eradicate this heterogeneity. Based on the 53Mn-53Cr systematics in HED meteorites and in chondrites rather narrow limits are inferred for the age of the solar system or, more accurately, for the start of the decay of 53Mn within the solar nebula; the range of possible values is 4568–4571 Ma. The lower limit is consistent with the Pb-Pb ages of CAI’s.}

On the basis of these data and our new planet formation simulations that include a realistic model for primordial oxygen isotopic reservoirs, our results favor vigorous mixing during the giant impact and therefore a high-energy, high-angular-momentum impact.

Measurements of lunar samples, however, reveal an oxygen isotope composition that is indistinguishable from terrestrial samples, and clearly distinct from meteorites coming from Mars and Vesta. Here we explore the possibility that the silicate Earth and impactor were compositionally distinct with respect to oxygen isotopes, and that the terrestrial magma ocean and lunar-forming material underwent turbulent mixing and equilibration in the energetic aftermath of the giant impact. This mixing may arise in the molten disk epoch between the impact and lunar accretion, lasting perhaps 102–103 yr. The implications of this idea for the geochemistry of the Moon, the origin of water on Earth, and constraints on the giant impact are discussed.}

abstract = { Recent comparisons of the isotopic compositions of the Earth and the Moon show that, unlike nearly every other body known in the Solar System, our satellite's isotopic ratios are nearly identical to the Earth's for nearly every isotopic system. The Moon's chemical make-up, however, differs from the Earth's in its low volatile content and perhaps in the elevated abundance of oxidized iron. This surprising situation is not readily explained by current impact models of the Moon's origin and offers a major clue to the Moon's formation, if we only could understand it properly. Current ideas to explain this similarity range from assuming an impactor with the same isotopic composition as the Earth to postulating a pure ice impactor that completely vaporized upon impact. Several recent proposals follow from the suggestion that the Earth–Moon system may have lost a great deal of angular momentum during early resonant interactions. The isotopic constraint may be the most stringent test yet for theories of the Moon's origin. }

In this work, we develop a coupled thermal-orbital evolution model that takes into account obliquity tidal heating in the lunar magma ocean. Dissipation in the magma ocean is so effective that it results in rapid inclination damping at semi-major axes beyond about 20 Earth radii (RE), because of the increase in lunar obliquity as the so-called Cassini state transition at ≈30 RE is approached. There is thus a “speed limit” on how fast the Moon can evolve outwards while maintaining its inclination: if it reaches 20 RE before the magma ocean solidifies, any early lunar inclination cannot be maintained. We find that for magma ocean lifetimes of 10 Myr or more, the Earth’s tidal quality factor Q must have been >300 to maintain primordial inclination, implying an early Earth 1–2 orders of magnitude less dissipative than at present. On the other hand, if tidal dissipation on the early Earth was stronger, our model implies rapid damping of the lunar inclination and requires subsequent late excitation of the lunar orbit after the crystallization of the lunar magma ocean.}

	abstract = {The final stage of terrestrial planet formation is known as the giant impact stage where protoplanets collide with one another to form planets. So far this stage has been mainly investigated by N-body simulations with an assumption of perfect accretion in which all collisions lead to accretion. However, this assumption breaks for collisions with high velocity and/or a large impact parameter. We derive an accretion condition for protoplanet collisions in terms of impact velocity and angle and masses of colliding bodies, from the results of numerical collision experiments. For the first time, we adopt this realistic accretion condition in N-body simulations of terrestrial planet formation from protoplanets. We compare the results with those with perfect accretion and show how the accretion condition affects terrestrial planet formation. We find that in the realistic accretion model about half of collisions do not lead to accretion. However, the final number, mass, orbital elements, and even growth timescale of planets are barely affected by the accretion condition. For the standard protoplanetary disk model, typically two Earth-sized planets form in the terrestrial planet region over about 108 yr in both realistic and perfect accretion models. We also find that for the realistic accretion model, the spin angular velocity is about 30% smaller than that for the perfect accretion model, which is as large as the critical spin angular velocity for rotational instability. The spin angular velocity and obliquity obey Gaussian and isotropic distributions, respectively, independently of the accretion condition.}

abstract = {After more than a century of doubt and equivocation, cyclostratigraphy – the stratigraphic record of astronomically forced paleoclimatic change – has come to be widely accepted in the geosciences. Cyclostratigraphy depicts a paleoclimate system that is intimately connected with and pervasively tuned to the variations of co-occurring astronomical and geophysical parameters that have affected the Earth through geologic time. Cyclostratigraphy provides a proprietary record of planetary orbital motions, and is the sole repository of evidence for interplanetary orbital resonance and chaotic interaction throughout Solar System history. Cyclostratigraphy has also recorded the evolution of Earth's rotation rate and mass distribution, and by consequence, the orbital dynamics of the Moon. For the most recent ten million years, cyclostratigraphy has been precisely correlated to quantitative astronomical models, and for hundreds of millions of years prior to that, has been matched to models with a progressively decreasing but still significant measure of confidence. This has led to the rise of astrochronology, which assigns cyclostratigraphy to a specific time scale based on its correlation to astronomical solutions. Modern astronomical solutions are highly consistent, indicating that the theory of Solar System dynamics has been described as completely as possible for 0 to at least 50 million years ago (Ma). This indicates that cyclostratigraphy can be correlated to the full Earth orbital eccentricity and/or inclination solution over 0–50Ma, to contribute a high-precision astrochronology for the geologic time scale. For times prior to 50Ma, astronomical models deviate substantially from one another as predicted by the Lyapunov time of the Solar System, and depict chaotic behavior, for example, between Earth and Mars. On the other hand, specific planetary orbits, notably those of Jupiter and Saturn, theoretically remain stable over much longer periods of time; these have led to the recognition of “metronomes” in Earth's orbital motions, specifically, g2−g5 and s3−s6, which when identified in cyclostratigraphy can provide practical extensions to the Astronomical Time Scale for hundreds of millions of years into the past.}

Tidal energy dissipation causes secular rates in the lunar mean motion n, semimajor axis a, and eccentricity e. Terrestrial dissipation causes most of the tidal change in n and a, but lunar dissipation decreases eccentricity rate. Terrestrial tidal dissipation also slows the rotation of the Earth and increases obliquity. A tidal acceleration model is used for integration of the lunar orbit. Analysis of lunar laser ranging (LLR) data provides two or three terrestrial and two lunar dissipation parameters. Additional parameters come from geophysical knowledge of terrestrial tides.

We have shown that analysis of ancient tidal rhythmite may help us to estimate the palaeolunar orbital periods in terms of lunar days/month accurately. Determination of absolute Earth–Moon distances and Earth's palaeorotational parameters in the distant geological past from tidal rhythmite, however, is ambiguous because of the difficulties in determining the absolute length of the ancient lunar sidereal month.}

abstract = {Forming the Moon by a high-angular momentum impact may explain the Earth-Moon isotopic similarities; however, the post-impact angular momentum needs to be reduced by a factor of 2 or more to the current value (1 LEM) after the Moon forms. Capture into the evection resonance, occurring when the lunar perigee precession period equals 1 year, could remove the angular momentum excess. However the appropriate angular momentum removal appears sensitive to the tidal model and chosen tidal parameters. In this work, we use a constant-time delay tidal model to explore the Moon's orbital evolution through evection. We find that exit from formal evection occurs early and that, subsequently, the Moon enters a quasi-resonance regime, in which evection still regulates the lunar eccentricity even though the resonance angle is no longer librating. Although not in resonance proper, during quasi-resonance angular momentum is continuously removed from the Earth-Moon system and transferred to Earth's heliocentric orbit. The final angular momentum, set by the timing of quasi-resonance escape, is a function of the ratio of tidal strength in the Moon and Earth and the absolute rate of tidal dissipation in the Earth. We consider a physically motivated model for tidal dissipation in the Earth as the mantle cools from a molten to a partially molten state. We find that as the mantle solidifies, increased terrestrial dissipation drives the Moon out of quasi-resonance. For post-impact systems that contain >2 LEM, final angular momentum values after quasi-resonance escape remain significantly higher than the current Earth-Moon value.},

abstract = {We address the thermal history of the Earth after the Moon-forming impact, taking tidal heating and thermal blanketing by the atmosphere into account. The atmosphere sets an upper bound of ∼100 W/m2 on how quickly the Earth can cool. The liquid magma ocean cools over 2–10 Myr, with longer times corresponding to high angular-momentum events. Tidal heating is focused mostly in mantle materials that are just beginning to freeze. The atmosphere's control over cooling sets up a negative feedback between viscosity-dependent tidal heating and temperature-dependent viscosity of the magma ocean. While the feedback holds, evolution of the Moon's orbit is limited by the modest radiative cooling rate of Earth's atmosphere. Orbital evolution is orders of magnitude slower than in conventional constant Q models, which promotes capture by resonances. The evection resonance is encountered early, when the Earth is molten. Capture by the evection resonance appears certain but unlikely to generate much eccentricity because it is encountered early when the Earth is molten and $Q_\oplus \gg Q_m$. Tidal dissipation in the Earth becomes more efficient ($Q_\oplus \ll Q_m$) later when the Moon is between $\approx 20 R_\oplus$ and $\approx 40 R\oplus$. If lunar eccentricity grew great, this was when it did so, perhaps setting the table for some other process to leave its mark on the inclination of the Moon.}

abstract = {The known extrasolar planets exhibit a wide range of orbital eccentricities e. This has a profound influence on their rotations and climates. Because of tides in their interiors, mostly solid exoplanets are expected eventually to despin to a state of spin-orbit resonance, where the orbital period is some integer or half-integer times the rotation period. The most important of these resonances is the synchronous state, where the planet's spin period exactly equals its orbital period (like Earth's Moon, and indeed most of the regular satellites in the Solar System). Such planets seem doomed to roast on one side and freeze on the other. However, synchronous planets rock back and forth by an angle of $∼2Arcsine$ with respect to the sub-stellar point. For $e=0.055$ (as for the Moon), this optical libration amounts to only $\approx 6°$; but for a synchronous planet with $e=0.50$, for example, it would rise to $∼59°$. This greatly expands the temperate “twilight zone” near the terminator and considerably improves the planet's prospects for habitability. For $e\approxgt0.72389$, the optical libration exceeds $90°$; for such planets, the sector of permanent night vanishes, while the sunniest region splits in two. Furthermore, the synchronous state is not the only possible spin resonance. For example, Mercury (with $e\approx0.206$) has an orbital period exactly $1.5$ times its rotation period. A terrestrial exoplanet with $e=0.40$, say, is liable to have an orbital period of $2.0$, $2.5$, or $3.0$ times its spin period. The corresponding insolation patterns are generally complicated, and all different from the synchronous state. Yet these non-synchronous resonances also protect certain longitudes from the worst extremes of temperature and solar radiation, and improve the planet's habitability, compared to non-resonant rotation. These results also have implications for the direct detectability of extrasolar planets, and the interpretation of their thermal emissions.}

abstract = {A previous paper [Dobrovolskis, A.R., 2007. Icarus 192, 1–23] showed that eccentricity can have profound effects on the climate, habitability, and detectability of extrasolar planets. This complementary study shows that obliquity can have comparable effects. The known exoplanets exhibit a wide range of orbital eccentricities, but those within several million kilometers of their suns are generally in near-circular orbits. This fact is widely attributed to the dissipation of tides in the planets. Tides in a planet affect its spin even more than its orbit, and such tidally evolved planets often are assumed to be in synchronous rotation, so that their rotation periods are identical to their orbital periods. The canonical example of synchronous spin is the way that our Moon always keeps nearly the same hemisphere facing the Earth. Tides also tend to reduce the planet’s obliquity (the angle between its spin and orbital angular velocities). However, orbit precession can cause the rotation to become locked in a “Cassini state”, where it retains a nearly constant non-zero obliquity. For example, our Moon maintains an obliquity of about $6.7°$ with respect to its orbit about the Earth. In comparison, stable Cassini states can exist for practically any obliquity up to $∼90°$ or more for planets of binary stars, or in multi-planet systems with high mutual inclinations, such as are produced by scattering or by the Kozai mechanism. This work considers planets in synchronous rotation with circular orbits, but arbitrary obliquity $\beta$; this affects the distribution of insolation over the planet’s surface, particularly near its poles. For $\beta=0$, one hemisphere bakes in perpetual sunshine, while the opposite hemisphere experiences eternal darkness. As $\beta$ increases, the region of permanent daylight and the antipodal realm of endless night both shrink, while a more temperate area of alternating day and night spreads in longitude, and especially in latitude. The regions of permanent day or night disappear at $\beta=90°$. The insolation regime passes through several more transitions as $\beta$ continues to increase toward $180°$, but the surface distribution of insolation remains non-uniform in both latitude and longitude. Thus obliquity, like eccentricity, can protect certain areas of the planet from the worst extremes of temperature and solar radiation, and can improve the planet’s habitability. These results also have implications for the direct detectability of extrasolar planets, and for the interpretation of their thermal emissions.}

The overall trend of these temperatures converges smoothly to that of the present-day MORB source, supporting the interpretation that the non-arc basalts formed by the melting of hot ambient mantle, not mantle plumes, and that they can constrain the thermal history of the Earth. These petrological results are very similar to those predicted by thermal models characterized by a low Urey ratio and more sluggish mantle convection in the past. We infer that the mantle was warming in deep Archean–Hadean time because internal heating exceeded surface heat loss, and it has been cooling from 2.5 to 3.0Ga to the present. Non-arc Precambrian basalts are likely to be similar to those that formed oceanic crust and erupted on continents. It is estimated that ∼25–35km of oceanic crust formed in the ancient Earth by about 30% melting of hot ambient mantle. In contrast, komatiite parental magmas reveal TP that are higher than those of non-arc basalts, consistent with the hot plume model. However, the associated excess magmatism was minor and oceanic plateaus, if they existed, would have had subtle bathymetric variations, unlike those of Phanerozoic oceanic plateaus. Primary magmas of Precambrian ambient mantle had 18–24% MgO, and they left behind residues of harzburgite that are now found as xenoliths of cratonic mantle. We infer that primary basaltic partial melts having 10–13% MgO are a feature of Phanerozoic magmatism, not of the early Earth, which may be why modern-day analogs of oceanic crust have not been reported in Archean greenstone belts.}

The relevant geophysical observations are outlined, and geotherms then obtained from parameterized convective models. Experimental observations which constrain the solidus and liquidus at various pressures are described by simple empirical functions. The variation in melt fraction is then parameterized by requiring a variation from 0 on the solidus to 1 on the liquidus.The composition of the melts is principally controlled by the melt fraction, though those of FeO, MgO, and SiO2 in addition vary with pressure. Another simple parameterization allows the observed compositions of major elements in 91 experiments to be calculated with a mean error of 1.1\\%, and those of TiO2 and Na2O to 0.3\\%. These expressions are then used to calculate the expected compositions of magma produced by adiabatic upwelling. The mean major element composition of the most magnesium-rich MORB glasses resemble the mean composition calculated for a mantle potential temperature Tp of 1280°C. Adiabatic melting during upwelling of mantle of this temperature generates a melt thickness of 7 km. The observed variations of the MgO and TiO2 concentrations in a large collection of MORB glass compositions suggest that extensive low pressure fractional crystallization occurs, but that its effect on the concentrations of SiO2, Al2O3, and CaO is small. There is no evidence that normal oceanic crust is produced from magmas containing more than 11\\% MgO. The mantle potential temperature within hot rising jets is about 1480°C and can generate 27 km of magma containing 17\\% MgO.Extension of the continental lithosphere generates little melt unless β\\&gt; 2 and Tp\\&gt; 1380°C. The melts generated by larger values of β or of Tp are alkali basalts, and change to tholeiites as the amount of melting increases. Large quantities of melt can be generated, especially at continental margins, where estimates of β obtained from changes in crustal thickness will in general be too small.}",

    abstract = { The inception of plate tectonics on Earth and its subsequent evolution are discussed on the basis of theoretical considerations and observational constraints. The likelihood of plate tectonics in the past depends on what mechanism is responsible for the relatively constant surface heat flux that is indicated by the likely thermal history of Earth. The continuous operation of plate tectonics throughout Earth's history is possible if, for example, the strength of convective stress in the mantle is affected by the gradual subduction of surface water. Various geological indicators for the emergence of plate tectonics are evaluated from a geodynamical perspective, and they invariably involve certain implicit assumptions about mantle dynamics, which are either demonstrably wrong or yet to be explored. The history of plate tectonics is suggested to be intrinsically connected to the secular evolution of the atmosphere, through sea-level changes caused by ocean-mantle interaction. }

Mark Harrison and colleagues now present an examination of inclusion assemblages in Hadean zircons from Jack Hills, Western Australia, which constrain the magmatic formation conditions to about 700{\textdegree}C and 7 kbar. This result implies a near-surface heat flow about three to five times lower than estimates of global Hadean heat flow. As the only site of magmatism on modern Earth that is characterized by heat flow of a quarter of the global average is above subduction zones, the authors suggest that the magmas from which the Jack Hills Hadean zircons crystallized, formed largely in an underthrust environment, perhaps similar to modern convergent margins.},

The first occurrence of UHT granulite metamorphism in the record signifies a change in geodynamics that generated transient sites of very high heat flow. Many UHT granulite metamorphic belts may have developed in settings analogous to modern continental backarcs; on a warmer Earth, destruction of oceans floored by thinner lithosphere may have generated hotter backarcs than those associated with the modern Pacific ring of fire. Medium-temperature eclogite–high- pressure (EHP) granulite metamorphism is documented in the Neoarchean rock record and at intervals throughout the Proterozoic and Paleozoic record. EHP granulite metamorphic belts are complementary to UHT granulite metamorphic belts in that they are generally inferred to record subduction-to-collision orogenesis. Blueschists become evident in the Neoproterozoic rock record, but lawsonite blueschist–eclogite metamorphism (high pressure [HP]) and ultrahigh-pressure metamorphism (UHP) characterized by coesite or diamond are predominantly Phanerozoic phenomena. HP-UHP metamorphism registers the low thermal gradients and deep subduction of continental crust during the early stage of subduction-to-collision orogenesis. A duality of metamorphic belts—reflecting a duality of thermal regimes—appears in the record only since the Neoarchean Era. A duality of thermal regimes is the hallmark of modern plate tectonics, and the duality of metamorphic belts is the characteristic imprint of plate tectonics in the rock record. The occurrence of both UHT and EHP granulite metamorphism since the Neoarchean marks the onset of a “Proterozoic plate tectonics” regime, which evolved during a Neoproterozoic transition to the modern plate tectonics regime, characterized by colder subduction as chronicled by HP-UHP metamorphism.}",

abstract={Detrital zircons from the Jack Hills (JH) metasedimentary belt of Western Australia are a record of the first ∼1.5 billion years of Earth history and can be used to help reconstruct the conditions of crust formation and secular changes therein. Beginning as early as ca. 4.3 Ga, but becoming more pronounced in the mid-Archean, a peraluminous signature begins to emerge from the JH zircon record. Combined with trace elements (P, REEs) and Ti-in-zircon thermometry, this increase in peraluminosity is likely the result of deep (>7 kbar) partial melting of hydrous mafic protoliths or partial melting of metasedimentary source material. In a geodynamic context, these results may suggest a gradual shift from a vertical tectonic regime toward a horizontal tectonic regime with potential subduction-like or collisional processes creating the necessary conditions for peraluminous melt generation beginning locally at least by ∼3.6 billion years ago (Ga).},

	abstract = {Studies of close-in planets orbiting M dwarfs have suggested that the M-dwarf radius valley may be well explained by distinct formation timescales between enveloped terrestrials and rocky planets that form at late times in a gas-depleted environment. This scenario is at odds with the picture that close-in rocky planets form with a primordial gaseous envelope that is subsequently stripped away by some thermally driven mass-loss process. These two physical scenarios make unique predictions of the rocky/enveloped transition’s dependence on orbital separation such that studying the compositions of planets within the M-dwarf radius valley may be able to establish the dominant physics. Here, we present the discovery of one such keystone planet: the ultra-short-period planet TOI-1634 b (P = 0.989 days, , R ⊕) orbiting a nearby M2 dwarf (K s  = 8.7, R s  = 0.450 R ⊙, M s  = 0.502 M ⊙) and whose size and orbital period sit within the M-dwarf radius valley. We confirm the TESS-discovered planet candidate using extensive ground-based follow-up campaigns, including a set of 32 precise radial velocity measurements from HARPS-N. We measure a planetary mass of M ⊕, which makes TOI-1634 b inconsistent with an Earth-like composition at and thus requires either an extended gaseous envelope, a large volatile-rich layer, or a rocky composition that is not dominated by iron and silicates to explain its mass and radius. The discovery that the bulk composition of TOI-1634 b is inconsistent with that of Earth supports the gas-depleted formation mechanism to explain the emergence of the radius valley around M dwarfs with M ⊙.}

The fit also detects the interstellar extinction for nearby stars with the amount E(B-V) = 0.235 ± 0.03 mag kpc-1. Taking our newly obtained relation as a reference, we examine a number of B-V color-temperature relations and atmosphere models available in the literature. We find with the Kurucz atmosphere a systematic error of 0.07 mag in B-V in the color-temperature relation across G–K5 dwarfs. On the other hand, the Bell-Gustafsson atmosphere gives colors in agreement with our empirical relation from F to G stars; for late-K stars, however, it gives colors that are too blue by 0.05 mag. We also argue for errors in the temperature scale adopted in popularly used stellar population synthesis models; synthetic colors from these models, based on the temperature calibration of Ridgway et al., may be too blue for aged elliptical galaxies. Finally, we derive the color index of the Sun to be (B-V)⊙ = 0.626 ± 0.018 and discuss that redder colors (e.g., 0.65–0.67) often quoted in the literature are incompatible with the color-temperature relation for normal stars.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We here develop an improved way of using a rotating star as a clock, set it using the Sun, and demonstrate that it keeps time well. This technique, called gyrochronology, derives ages for low-mass main-sequence stars using only their rotation periods and colors. The technique is developed here and used to derive ages for illustrative groups of nearby field stars with measured rotation periods. We first demonstrate the reality of the interface sequence, the unifying feature of the rotational observations of cluster and field stars that makes the technique possible, and extend it beyond the proposal of Skumanich by specifying the mass dependence of rotation for these stars. We delineate which stars it cannot currently be used on. We then calibrate the age dependence using the Sun. The errors are propagated to understand their dependence on color and period. Representative age errors associated with the technique are estimated at ~15% (plus possible systematic errors) for late F, G, K, and early M stars. Gyro ages for the Mount Wilson stars are shown to be in good agreement with chromospheric ages for all but the bluest stars, and probably superior. Gyro ages are then calculated for each of the active main-sequence field stars studied by Strassmeier and collaborators. These are shown to have a median age of 365 Myr. The sample of single field stars assembled by Pizzolato and collaborators is then assessed and shown to have gyro ages ranging from under 100 Myr to several Gyr, with a median age of 1.2 Gyr. Finally, we demonstrate that the individual components of the three wide binaries ξ Boo AB, 61 Cyg AB, and α Cen AB yield substantially the same gyro ages.}

	abstract = {Many exoplanets have been discovered with radii of $1-4 \, R_\oplus$, between that of Earth and Neptune. A number of these are known to have densities consistent with solid compositions, while others are “sub-Neptunes” likely to have significant $\text{H}_2$-He envelopes. Future surveys will no doubt significantly expand these populations. In order to understand how the measured masses and radii of such planets can inform their structures and compositions, we construct models both for solid layered planets and for planets with solid cores and gaseous envelopes, exploring a range of core masses, $\text{H}_2$-He envelope masses, and associated envelope entropies. For planets in the super-Earth/sub-Neptune regime for which both radius and mass are measured, we estimate how each is partitioned into a solid core and gaseous envelope, associating a specific core mass and envelope mass with a given exoplanet. We perform this decomposition for both ``Earth-like'' rock-iron cores and pure ice cores, and find that the necessary gaseous envelope masses for this important sub-class of exoplanets must range very widely from zero to many Earth masses, even for a given core mass. This result bears importantly on exoplanet formation and envelope evaporation processes.}

	title = {On the Rotational Evolution of Solar- and Late-Type Stars, Its Magnetic Origins, and the Possibility of Stellar Gyrochronology},
	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We propose a simple interpretation of the rotation period data for solar- and late-type stars. The open cluster and Mount Wilson star observations suggest that rotating stars lie primarily on two sequences, initially called I and C. Some stars lie in the intervening gap. These sequences, and the fractional numbers of stars on each sequence, evolve systematically with cluster age, enabling us to construct crude rotational isochrones allowing "stellar gyrochronology," a procedure, on improvement, likely to yield ages for individual field stars. The age and color dependences of the sequences allow the identification of the underlying mechanism, which appears to be primarily magnetic. The majority of solar- and late-type stars possess a dominant Sun-like, or interface, magnetic field, which connects the convective envelope to both the radiative interior of the star and the exterior, where winds can drain off angular momentum. These stars spin down Skumanich style. An age-decreasing fraction of young G, K, and M stars, which are rapid rotators, possess only a convective field, which is not only inefficient in depleting angular momentum but also incapable of coupling the surface convection zone to the inner radiative zone, so that only the outer zone is spun down, and on an exponential timescale. These stars do not yet possess large-scale dynamos. The large-scale magnetic field associated with the dynamo, apparently created by the shear between the decoupled radiative and convective zones, (re)couples the convective and radiative zones and drives a star from the convective to the interface sequence through the gap on a timescale that increases as stellar mass decreases. Fully convective stars do not possess such an interface, cannot generate an interface dynamo, and hence can never make such a transition. Helioseismic results for the present-day Sun agree with this scheme, which also explains the rotational bimodality observed by Herbst and collaborators among pre-main-sequence stars and the termination of this bimodality when stars become fully convective. This paradigm also provides a new basis for understanding stellar X-ray and chromospheric activity, light-element abundances, and perhaps other stellar phenomena that depend on rotation.}

The solar gravitational pull on the Moon, being 2.2x terrestrial pull, causes lunar drift, orbital elongation, and an ~1000 km radial monthly excursion of the Earth-Moon barycenter inside Earth’s mantle. Earth’s spin superimposes an approximately longitudinal 24 h circuit of the barycenter. Because the oscillating barycenter lies 3500-5500 km from the geocenter, Earth’s tangential orbital acceleration and solar pull are imbalanced. Near-surface motions are enabled by a weak low-velocity zone underlying the cold, brittle lithosphere: The thermal states of both layers result from leakage of Earth’s internal radiogenic heat to space. Concomitantly, stress induced by spin cracks the lithosphere in a classic X-pattern, creating mid-ocean ridges and plate segments. The inertial response of our high-spin planet with its low-velocity zone is $\approx 10 \text{cm yr}^{-1}$ westward drift of the entire lithosphere, which largely dictates plate motions. The thermal profile causes sinking plates to thin and disappear by depths of ~200-660 km, depending on angle and speed. Cyclical stresses are effective agents of failure, thereby adding asymmetry to plate motions. A comparison of rocky planets shows that the presence and longevity of volcanism and tectonism depend on the particular combination of moon size, moon orbital orientation, proximity to the Sun, and rates of body spin and cooling. Earth is the only rocky planet with all the factors needed for plate tectonics.}",

Most of the transiting planets are smaller than three times the size of Earth. For 16 planets, the Doppler signal was securely detected, providing a direct measurement of the planet's mass. For the other 26 planets we provide either marginal mass measurements or upper limits to their masses and densities; in many cases we can rule out a rocky composition. We identify six planets with densities above 5 g cm−3, suggesting a mostly rocky interior for them. Indeed, the only planets that are compatible with a purely rocky composition are smaller than ∼2 R⊕. Larger planets evidently contain a larger fraction of low-density material (H, He, and H2O).}

Liquid oceans on icy worlds, if present, exert a considerable influence on the dynamics of the ice–ocean system and, because of the astrobiological potential, represent an important objective for future missions to the outer solar system. The Pluto–Charon system is representative of an icy moon orbiting a dwarf planet that is believed to have formed from the remnants of a giant impact. The evolution of icy moons is primarily controlled by the mode and efficiency of heat transfer through the outer ice shell, which is influenced by the presence of impurities, by tidal dissipation in the ice shell, and by the radioactive element budget in the silicate core. Previous studies on the evolution of the Pluto–Charon system generally considered either only the thermal or the tidal evolution, and in the cases where both were considered, the important effect of the presence of impurities in the liquid oceans was not addressed. Here, we consider the joint tidal–thermal evolution of the Pluto–Charon system by combining a comprehensive tidal model that incorporates a viscoelastic description of the tidal response with a parameterized thermal convection model developed for icy worlds. This approach enables an extensive analysis of the conditions required for the formation and maintenance of subsurface liquid oceans up to the present. Our results show that because of relatively fast circularization and synchronization of the orbits of Pluto and Charon, tidal heating is only important during the early stages of evolution (<1 Myr). As part of our study, we test the sensitivity of our results to a number of parameters that pertain to the orbital and thermal history. In all the studied cases, oceans on Pluto are always predicted to remain liquid to the present, ranging in thickness from 40 km to 150-km, whereas oceans on Charon, while in-place for approximately 4 Gyr, have solidified. This is supported by New Horizons observations of primarily extensional faults on Pluto and both extensional and compressional faults on Charon.}

The results of an extensive Kepler follow-up program including multiple Doppler measurements for 22 planet-hosting stars more than doubles the population of sub-Neptune-sized transiting planets that have RV mass constraints. This unprecedentedly large and homogeneous sample of planets with both mass and radius constraints opens the possibility of a statistical study of the underlying population of planet compositions. We focus on the intriguing transition between rocky exoplanets (comprised of iron and silicates) and planets with voluminous layers of volatiles (H/He and astrophysical ices). Applying a hierarchical Bayesian statistical approach to the sample of Kepler transiting sub-Neptune planets with Keck RV follow-up, we constrain the fraction of close-in planets (with orbital periods less than ∼50 days) that are sufficiently dense to be rocky, as a function of planet radius. We show that the majority of planets have too low density to be comprised of Fe and silicates alone. At larger radii, the constraints on the fraction of rocky planets are even more stringent. These insights into the size demographics of rocky and volatile-rich planets offer empirical constraints to planet formation theories, and guide the range of planet radii to be considered in studies of the occurrence rate of “Earth-like” planets, .}

Observations of Io at M (4.8 μm), 8.7 μm, N (10 μm), and Q (20 μm) with the Infrared Telescope Facility presented here were collected during nine apparitions between 1983 and 1993. These measurements provide full longitudinal coverage as well as an eclipse observation and the detection of two outbursts. Reflected sunlight, passive thermal emission, and radiation from thermal anomalies all contribute to the observed flux densities. We find that a new thermophysical model is required to match all the data. Two key elements of this model are (1) a “thermal reservoir” unit which lowers daytime temperatures, and (2) the “thermal pedestal effect” which shifts to shorter wave-lengths the spectral emission due to the reradiation of solar energy absorbed by the thermal anomalies. The thermal anomalies are modeled with a total of 10 source components at five locations. Io's heat flow is the sum of the power from these components.},

abstract = {The study of the thermal evolution of Earth’s interior is uncertain and controversial in many respects, from the interpretation of petrologic observations used to infer the temperature and dynamics of the interior, to the physics and material properties governing heat transport. The thermal history of Venus is even more uncertain, but the lack of a dynamo at present in an otherwise similar planet may provide additional constraints on terrestrial planet evolution. In this paper a one dimensional thermal history model is derived that includes heat loss due to mantle melt eruption at the surface to explore its influence on the thermal and magnetic history of Earth and Venus. We show that the thermal catastrophe of Earth’s mantle, which occurs for a present day Urey ratio of 1/3 and convective heat loss exponent of β=1/3, can be avoided by assuming a rather high core heat flow of ∼15TW. This core heat flow also avoids the new core paradox by allowing for the geodynamo to be thermally powered prior to inner core growth for core thermal conductivities as high as 130Wm-1K-1. Dynamo regime diagrams demonstrate that the mantle melt eruption rate has a minor effect on the history of mobile lid planets due to the efficiency of plate tectonic convective heat loss. However, if Earth were in a stagnant lid regime prior to 2.5Ga, as has been proposed, then at least ∼5% of mantle melt is required to erupt in order to thermally power the paleodynamo at that time. Dynamo regime diagrams for stagnant lid Venus models indicate that more than half of the melt generated in the mantle is required to erupt in order to overcome the insulation imposed by the stagnant lid and drive a dynamo. This implies that with an Earth-like mantle radioactivity the Venusian dynamo shut down ∼0.3Ga for an eruption efficiency of 50%, and ∼3Ga for an eruption efficiency of zero. Consequently, a stagnant lid alone does not prevent a core dynamo if melting of the upper mantle provides a substantial mantle heat sink.}

abstract = {Electron microprobe results are reported for liquid and crystalline phases that were synthesized at 5–22.5 GPa in multianvil experiments on anhydrous peridotite KLB-1 [Zhang and Herzberg, 1994]. The results provide information on the partitioning of TiO2, Al2O3, Cr2O3, FeO, MnO, MgO, Na2O, and NiO among liquid and the crystalline phases olivine, modified spinel, garnet, magnesiowustite, and magnesium perovskite. Uncertainties in these partition coefficients stem from quenching problems and from the effects of thermal migration of liquid in a temperature gradient. We have, however, exploited the temperature gradients by determining how the crystalline phase chemistry varies throughout the melting interval from the liquidus to the solidus. This has permitted new constraints to be obtained on the compositions of liquids along the anhydrous peridotite solidus at low melt fractions and at pressures in the 5–18 GPa range. It is demonstrated that the wide range of Al2O3 and CaO/Al2O3 contents in picrites and komatiites can be explained by melt segregation at upper mantle pressures that ranged from 3 to ∼10 GPa. These magmas could have formed by anhydrous melting in plumes with temperatures that were only 100°–200°C higher than ambient mantle below ridges, demonstrating that unusually hot conditions are not required to form komatiites. Primary igneous MgO contents in excess of 26\% should be rare, and those that do exist in some komatiites can be explained by advanced melting during adiabatic or superadiabatic ascent, by low Na2O in the source, or by melting in hot plumes from the transition zone and lower mantle. Evidence for deep melting in hot plumes is rather conjectural, but it may be contained in some 2700 Myr komatiites that have high MgO and mantle-like CaO/Al2O3.},

abstract = {We investigated the melting properties of a synthetic chondritic primitive mantle up to core–mantle boundary (CMB) pressures, using laser-heated diamond anvil cell. Melting criteria are essentially based on the use of X-rays provided by synchrotron radiation. We report a solidus melting curve lower than previously determined using optical methods. The liquidus curve is found between 300 and 600K higher than the solidus over the entire lower mantle. At CMB pressures (135GPa), the chondritic mantle solidus and liquidus reach 4150 (±150) K and 4725 (±150) K, respectively. We discuss that the lower mantle is unlikely to melt in the D″-layer, except if the highest estimate of the temperature profile at the base of the mantle, which is associated with a very hot core, is confirmed. Therefore, recent suggestions of partial melting in the lowermost mantle based on seismic observations of ultra-low velocity zones indicate either (1) a outer core exceeding 4150K at the CMB or (2) the presence of chemical heterogeneities with high concentration of fusible elements. Our observations of a high liquidus temperature as well as a large gap between solidus and liquidus temperatures have important implications for the properties of the magma ocean during accretion. Not only complete melting of the lower mantle would require excessively high temperatures, but also, below liquidus temperatures partial melting should take place over a much larger depth interval than previously thought. In addition, magma adiabats suggest very high surface temperatures in case of a magma ocean that would extend to more than 40GPa, as suggested by siderophile metal–silicate partitioning data. Such high surface temperature regime, where thermal blanketing is inefficient, points out to a transient character of the magma ocean, with a very fast cooling rate.}

abstract = {Several episodes of complete melting have probably occurred during the first stages of the Earth's evolution. We have developed a numerical model to monitor the thermal and melt fraction evolutions of a cooling and crystallizing magma ocean from an initially fully molten mantle. For this purpose, we numerically solve the heat equation in 1D spherical geometry, accounting for turbulent heat transfer, and integrating recent and strong experimental constraints from mineral physics. We have explored different initial magma ocean viscosities, compositions, thermal boundary layer thicknesses and initial core temperatures. We show that the cooling of a thick terrestrial magma ocean is a fast process, with the entire mantle becoming significantly more viscous within 20 kyr. Due to the slope difference between the adiabats and the melting curves, the solidification of the molten mantle occurs from the bottom up. In the meantime, a crust forms due to the high surface radiative heat flow, the last drop of fully molten silicate is restricted to the upper mantle. Among the studied parameters, the magma ocean lifetime is primarily governed by its viscosity. Depending on the thermal boundary layer thickness at the core–mantle boundary, the thermal coupling between the core and magma ocean can either insulate the core during the magma ocean solidification and favor a hot core or drain the heat out of the core simultaneously with the cooling of the magma ocean. Reasonable thickness for the thermal boundary layer, however, suggests rapid core cooling until the core–mantle boundary temperature results in a sluggish lowermost mantle. Once the crystallization of the lowermost mantle becomes significant, the efficiency of the core heat loss decreases. Since a hotter liquidus favors crystallization at hotter temperatures, a hotter deep mantle liquidus favors heat retention within the core. In the context of an initially fully molten mantle, it is difficult to envision the formation of a basal magma ocean or to prevent a major heat depletion of the core. As a consequence, an Earth's geodynamo sustained only by core cooling during 4 Gyr seems unlikely and other sources of motion need to be invoked.}

The data set was supplemented with a special study of 12 years of ISC phase data which yielded an additional 1.75 × 106 travel time observations for P and S waves. In order to obtain satisfactory agreement with the entire data set we were required to take into account anelastic dispersion. The introduction of transverse isotropy into the outer 220 km of the mantle was required in order to satisfy the shorter period fundamental toroidal and spheroidal modes. This anisotropy also improved the fit of the larger data set. The horizontal and vertical velocities in the upper mantle differ by 2–4\backslash, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not required to be anisotropic. Mantle Rayleigh waves are surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper mantle. High Sn velocities, low Pn velocities and a pronounced low-velocity zone are features of most global inversion models that are suppressed when anisotropy is allowed for in the inversion. The Preliminary Reference Earth Model, PREM, and auxiliary tables showing fits to the data are presented.}

    abstract = "{In most mantle convection studies with variable thermal expansivity only the pressure dependence is considered. Here we investigate the effect of temperature- and/or pressure-dependent thermal expansivity α on the distribution of buoyancy forces in mantle convection. Thermal expansivity is calculated for the dominant upper-mantle mineral, forsterite, and a map of its dependence on T and p is given. By studying simple 2-D steady-state constant-viscosity convection and comparing cases with constant α, α(p), α(T) and α(p, T) we find that at mantle temperatures the pressure dependence of α is important. For the lithosphere the dependence of α on temperature dominates, since the temperature dependence of α is much stronger in the low-pressure regime. Also dynamic topography changes considerably (up to 15 per cent) if α is T- and p-dependent compared with a constant or only p-dependent case. Scaling laws for the Nusselt number and the rms velocity are obtained. They differ from the constant-α case by at most 12 per cent if an effective Rayleigh number based on the spatial average of α is used.}",

abstract = {Of the terrestrial planets, Earth and probably Mercury possess substantial intrinsic magnetic fields generated by core dynamos, while Venus and Mars apparently lack such fields. Thermal histories are calculated for these planets and are found to admit several possible present states, including those which suggest simple explanations for the observations; whule the cores of Earth and Mercury are continuing to freeze, the cores of Venus and Mars may still be completely liquid. The models assume whole mantle convection, which is parameterized by a simple Nusselt-Rayleigh number relation and dictates the rate at which heat escapes from the core. It is found that completely fluid cores, devoid of intrinsic heat sources, are not likely to sustain thermal convection for the age of the solar system but cool to a subadiabatic, conductive state that can not maintain a dynamo. Planets which nucleate an inner core continue to sustain a dynamo because of the gravitational energy release and chemically driven convection that accompany inner core growth. The absence of a significant inner core can arise in Venus because of its slightly higher temperature and lower central pressure relative to Earth, while a Martian core avoids the onset of freezing if the abundance of sulfur in the core is $⪆15\%$ by mass. All of the models presented assume that (I) core dynamos are driven by thermal and/or chemical convection; (ii) radiogenic heat production is confined to the mantle; (iii) mantle and core cool from initially hot states which are at the solidus and superliquidus, respectively; and (iv) any inner core excludes the light alloying material (sulfur or oxygen) which then mixes uniformly upward through the outer core. The models include realistic pressure and composition-dependent freezing curves for the core, and material parameters are chosen so that the correct present-day values of heat outflow, upper mantle temperature and viscosity, and inner core radius are obtained for the earth. It is found that Venus and Mars may have once had dynamos maintained by thermal convection alone. Earth may have had a completely fluid core and a dynamo maintained by thermal convection for the first 2 to 3 by, but an inner core nucleates and the dynamo energetics are subsequently dominated by gravitational energy release. Complete freezing of the Mercurian core is prohibited if it contains even a small amount of sulfur, and a dynamo can be maintained by chemical convection in a thin, fluid shell.}

title = {Tidally Heated Exomoons around Gas Giants},
journal = {The Planetary Science Journal},
abstract = {Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered; however, the detection of exomoons remains elusive. Tidally heated exomoons have been proposed as candidate targets for observation; vigorous tidal dissipation can raise the moon’s surface temperature, making direct imaging possible, and cause widespread volcanism that can have a signature in transits. We assess whether the required amounts of tidal dissipation can be attained and how long it can be sustained. In a first step, we look at the thermal state of a super-Io for different orbital configurations. We show that close-in exomoons with moderate ) to high () orbital eccentricities can feature surface heat fluxes 1–3 orders of magnitude higher than that of Io if heat transfer is dominated by heat piping or the moon has a magma ocean. In a second step, we investigate the longevity of a super-Io. The free eccentricity of an isolated close-in exomoon is quickly dampened due to tides; high orbital eccentricities can be maintained if the moon is in a mean-motion resonance with another moon and the planet is highly dissipative. However, this scenario leads to fast orbital migration. For a Mars-sized exomoon, we find that tides alone can raise the surface temperatures to more than 400 K for 10 million yr, and surface heat fluxes higher than that of Io can be maintained for billions of years. Such tidally active bodies are expected to feature more vigorous volcanic activity than Io. The material outgassed via volcanism might be detected in transits.}
