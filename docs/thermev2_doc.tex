\section{Introduction\label{sec:intro}}

This document provides a description of a model to simulate the thermal evolution of the Earth's interior, that is, the time evolution of the characteristic temperatures of the mantle and core of the Earth throughout its history, which is mainly based on the models developed by \citet{stevensonetal1983} and \citep{tosietal2017} including the heat generated by tidal interaction.

The earth is considered to be divided into two parts: the core and the mantle (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Earth_interior}). Both are bounded by two concentric spherical surfaces, an outer one of radius $R_\oplus$, which is the mean radius of the Earth, and the inner one of radius $R_\text{c}$, which is equal to the radius of the core. The latter defines the core-mantle boundary (CMB).

Both the thermal evolution of the core and the mantle are obtained from the energy balance within each layer. Thus, the time evolution of the average internal temperatures of the mantle and core are determined by the balance between the incoming and outgoing heat flux, heat sources and sinks. Among the energy sources are considered radiative decay, both in the mantle and in the core, and the aforementioned tidal interaction, which is assumed to be uniformly distributed in the mantle only. The energy sinks of the mantle are the heat that propagates by convection from the core to the surface and the heat absorbed or released upon melting or solidification of the material that composes the mantle.

\section{Theoretical background\label{sec:theory}}

Let us begin from first principles. Both, the core and mantle, are considered as two separated systems in contact. The thermal states of each of them is characterized by their internal energy, $U$. Since temperatures within Earth's core and mantle are considered to vary with time, then their internal energies will also be time-dependant. The time evolution of $U$ can be tracked by the continuity equation:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:Ucontinuity}
      \fdiff{U}{t} + \oiint_S \vec{q} \cdot \text{d} \vec{S} = \fdiff{U_\text{gen}}{t},
\end{equation} where $t$ is time, $\vec{q}$ is the energy flux, which is integrated over a closed surface $S$, and the the term on the right hand side of Eq.~\eqref{ec:Ucontinuity} is the time rate at which the internal energy is generated by sources inside the surface. 

Now, let us rewrite Eq.~\eqref{ec:Ucontinuity} in a more convenient form. To this end, we will consider the first principle of thermodynamics, which relates the change of internal energy ($\Delta U$), the amount of heat exchanged ($Q$), and work ($W$) as:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:first_pple}
      \Delta U = Q - W.
\end{equation} Work is related to volume change of the considered system. However, we assume that the volume of both the core and the mantle are fixed, then $W = 0$, and:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:first_pple_UQ}
      \Delta U = Q,
\end{equation} that is, the internal energy changes because of exchange of heat between core and mantle, and between mantle and external space. Thus, Eq.~\eqref{ec:Ucontinuity} is rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:Qcontinuity}
      \fdiff{Q}{t} + \oiint_S \vec{q} \cdot \text{d} \vec{S} = \fdiff{Q_\text{gen}}{t},
\end{equation} where $\vec{q}$ can now formally be identified as the heat flux. Let us consider first the expression of the amount of heat exchanged. For both the core and the mantle we will assume that the heat transferred produces a change in the temperatures ($\Delta T$) and partial melting. Thus, $Q$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:Qgral}
      Q = M \, c \, \Delta T + L \, M_\text{melt},
\end{equation} where $M$ is the mass, $c$ is the specific heat, $L$ is the latent heat, and $M_\text{melt}$ is the mass of molten or solidified material. Like the volume, the masses of the core and mantle are also assumed constant as well as their physical parameter such as the specific and latent heat. Thus, the rate of change of exchanged heat is associated to changes in temperatures and mass of molten materials. Then, we have:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:dQdtgral}
      \fdiff{Q}{t} = M \, c \, \fdiff{T}{t} + L \, \fdiff{M_\text{melt}}{t}.
\end{equation} As we will be explained later, temperature varies within both mantle and core and we will assume that their internal temperatures are function of time and depth (or distance from Earth center, $r$). Since Eq.~\eqref{ec:dQdtgral} is valid for the core and mantle each of them considered as a whole, then the symbol $T$ actually stands for the mean temperature of each layer.

Let us consider now the second term on the left hand side of Eq.~\eqref{ec:Qcontinuity}. In order to compute the surface integral, the core and the mantle need to be considered separately. First of all, in both cases the heat is assumed to flow radially from the Earth's center to its surface. Thus, the heat flux can be expressed as $\vec{q} (t) = q (t) \, \hat{\vec{r}}$, where $\hat{\vec{r}}$ is a unit vector pointing outwards the Earth in radial direction. In addition, the surface element $\text{d} \vec{S}$ can be rewritten as $\text{d} \vec{S} = \vec{n} \, \text{d}S$, where $\vec{n}$ is an unit vector normal to each limiting surface. So, in general, we have that $\vec{q} (t) \cdot \text{d} \, \vec{S} = q (t) \, \text{d}S \left(\hat{\vec{r}} \cdot \vec{n}\right) = \pm q (t) \, \text{d}S$, depending on whether unit vectors $\vec{n}$ and $\hat{\vec{r}}$ have the same or opposite direction. For the core we have that $\vec{q}_c^\text{out} (t) \cdot \text{d} \, \vec{S} = q_c^\text{out} (t) \, \text{d}S$, because unit vectors $\vec{n}$ and $\hat{\vec{r}}$ have the same direction, as can be noted from Fig.~\ref{fig:flujo_nucleo}. In consequence:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:oint_core}
      \oiint_{S_c} \vec{q}_c^\text{out} \cdot \text{d} \vec{S} = \oiint_{S_c} q_c^\text{out} (t) \, \text{d}S = q_c^\text{out} (t) \oiint_{S_c} \text{d}S = q_c^\text{out} (t) \, A_c
\end{equation} where $S_c$ indicates that the integration is performed over the core's surface and $A_c$ is the surface area of the core. In the case of the mantle, the surface integral must be divided into two parts, one Corresponding to the inner limiting surface and the other to the outer limiting surface:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:oint_mantle}
      \begin{split}
            \oiint_{S_m} \vec{q}_m^\text{out} \cdot \text{d} \vec{S} &= \oiint_{S_m^\text{inner}} \vec{q}_m^\text{in} \cdot \text{d} \vec{S} + \oiint_{S_m^\text{outer}} \vec{q}_m^\text{out} \cdot \text{d} \vec{S} \\
            &= \oiint_{S_{m}^\text{inner}} q_m^\text{in} (t) \, \text{d}S
      \end{split}
\end{equation} The computation of the second integral on the right hand side of Eq.~\eqref{ec:oint_mantle} is totally analogous to the case of the core. Thus:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:oint_mantle_outer}
      \oiint_{S_m^\text{outer}} \vec{q}_m^\text{out} \cdot \text{d} \vec{S} = \oiint_{S_m^\text{outer}} q_m^\text{out} (t) \, \text{d}S = q_m^\text{out} (t) \, A_\oplus,
\end{equation} where $A_\oplus$ is the surface area of the Earth. As for the first integral on the right hand side of Eq.~\eqref{ec:oint_mantle}, we have to take into account, on one hand, that the dot product is negative because $\hat{\vec{r}}$ and $\vec{n}$ have opposite directions and, on the other hand, that the inner surface area of the mantle is equal to the core's surface area, i.e. $S_{m}^\text{inner} = S_c$. Then:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec_oint_mantle_inner}
      \oiint_{S_m^\text{inner}} \vec{q}_m^\text{in} \cdot \text{d} \vec{S} = \oiint_{S_m^\text{inner}} q_m^\text{in} (t) \, \text{d}S = q_m^\text{in} (t) \, A_c.
\end{equation} Moreover, for continuity reasons, and because Earth's core and mantle are in contact with each other, we have that $q_m^\text{in} (t) = q_c^\text{out} (t) = q_\textsc{cmb} (t)$.

Lastly, as we pointed out before, we assume that radioactive decay is a heat source for both the core and the mantle, while tidal heating is present only in the latter. Thus, for the core we have that
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:dQgendt_core}
      \fdiff{Q_\text{gen}}{t} = \dot{Q}_\text{rad,c},
\end{equation} and for the mantle:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:mantle}
      \fdiff{Q_\text{gen}}{t} = \dot{Q}_\text{rad,m} + \dot{Q}_\text{tidal}.
\end{equation}

Then, putting everything together we arrive to the equation governing the thermal evolution of both the core and the mantle:
\begin{align}
      M_c \, c_c \, \fdiff{\valmed{T}_c}{t} + \left(L_c + E_G\right) \, \fdiff{M_\text{ic}}{t} + \dot{Q}_\textsc{cmb} (t) &= \dot{Q}_\text{rad,c} (t) \label{ec:dTmdt_core_gral} \\
      M_m \, c_m \, \fdiff{\valmed{T}_m}{t} + L_m \, \fdiff{M_\text{melt}}{t} - \dot{Q}_\textsc{cmb} (t) + \dot{Q}_\text{conv} (t) &= \dot{Q}_\text{rad,m} (t) + \dot{Q}_\text{tidal} (t), \label{ec:dTmdt_mantle_gral}
\end{align} where the subscripts $c$ and $m$ refers to quantities related to the core and mantle, respectively, $\valmed{T}_i$ (with $i=c,m$) denotes the average temperature of each layer, $\dot{Q}_\textsc{cmb} (t) = q_\textsc{cmb} (t) \, A_c$ and $\dot{Q}_\text{conv} = q_m^\text{out} \, A_\oplus$.

The second term on the left hand side of both Eq.~\eqref{ec:dTmdt_core_gral} and Eq.~\eqref{ec:dTmdt_mantle_gral} are slightly different from that of Eq.~\eqref{ec:dQdtgral} because melting or solidification process in the core and the mantle are different from each other. While the mass of molten material in the mantle, denoted by $M_\text{melt}$, is concentrated in a zone called asthenosphere, which is near the Earth's surface, we assume that the core is completely molten at the beginning of the Earth's history and that solidified core materials precipitate to Earth's center as it cools down forming a solid inner core. Thus, the mass of solidified material within the core is equal to the inner core mass ($M_\text{ic}$). In addition we take into account the gravitational energy release upon solidification of core materials through the parameter $E_G$, which is assumed constant.

In the following subsections, the expressions of the heat fluxes, heat sources, and time rates of melt mass in the mantle and of the inner core mass will be given.

\subsection{Temperature profile of the Earth's interior}

On geological timescales, the dominant heat transport mechanism is convection. For the sake of simplicity, we assume a whole mantle convection \citep{stevensonetal1983}. However, models considering two layers convection within mantle has been developed \citep[and references therein]{schubertetal2001}. The vigor of convection can be measured by the Rayleigh number (Ra). In the case of a fluid limited by two horizontal surfaces and heated from below, analog to Earth's conditions, the Rayleigh number is given by:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:Rayleigh_num_def}
      \text{Ra} = \frac{\rho \, \alpha \, g \, \Delta T \, L^3}{\kappa \, \eta (T)},
\end{equation} where $\rho$, $\alpha$, $\kappa$ and $\eta$ are the fluid's density, volumetric expansion coefficient, thermal diffusivity, and dynamical viscosity, respectively, while $\Delta T$ is the temperature jump across the layer of thickness $L$. In Eq.~\eqref{ec:Rayleigh_num_def} we have included the strong dependence of the viscosity on the temperature, which is evaluated at a characteristic temperature of the layer. If Rayleigh number is above some threshold, called the critical Rayleigh number ($\text{Ra}_\text{cr}$), then heat is transported by convection and if it is below that threshold, then heat is transferred by conduction.

\end{figure}

If convection is sufficiently vigorous, the temperature profile across the layer where convection occurs (in our case, the mantle) is characterized by two thermal boundary layers, each of them lying on one of the limiting surface, in which heat is transported by conduction and an intermediate region where the fluid, or specifically mantle materials, is assumed to be well mixed and then an adiabatic temperature profile is assumed for this region. In Figure~\ref{fig:Tdr_manto} an schematics of the temperature profile across mantle is presented. Thus, the Rayleigh number for a whole mantle convection mode is given by \citep{stevensonetal1983,schubertetal2001}:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:Ra_mantle}
      \text{Ra} = \frac{\rho_\text{m} \, \alpha_\text{m} \, g \, \left(\Delta T_\textsc{ubl} + \Delta T_\textsc{lbl}\right) \, \left(R_\oplus - R_\text{c}\right)^3}{\kappa_\text{m} \, \eta(T_\textsc{ubl})}.
\end{equation} As can be noted, $R_\oplus - R_\text{c}$ is the mantle thickness, $\Delta T_\textsc{ubl} + \Delta T_\textsc{lbl}$ is the total temperature jump across the mantle and the viscosity is evaluated at the temperature at the base of the upper thermal boundary layer, $T_\textsc{ubl}$ \citep{stevensonetal1983}. In Equation~\eqref{ec:Ra_mantle} $g$ is the surface gravity while $\rho_\text{m}$, $\alpha_\text{m}$, and $\kappa_\text{m}$ are the density, thermal expansivity, and thermal diffusivity of the mantle assumed to be constant throughout this layer.

\end{figure}

Let us consider the temperature profile inside the thermal boundary layers. To this end, we will derive the temperature distribution across a hollow sphere assuming that heat flows radially outwards. As it is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Tdr_esfera_hueca}, $R_\text{in}$ and $R_\text{out}$ are the radii of the inner and outer spherical surfaces, respectively. The former is assumed to be at the temperature $T_\text{in}$, while the latter is at the temperature $T_\text{out}$, with $T_\text{in} > T_\text{out}$. The thickness of the hollow sphere is $\delta = R_\text{out} - R_\text{in}$. First, we will make use of the continuity equation in its differential form:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:continuity_eq_diff}
      \pdiff{u}{t} + \nabla \cdot \vec{q} = 0.
\end{equation} As can be noted, we neglect heat sources within the considered layer. The next step is to consider the steady state heat flow. In that case, we have that:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:cont_eq_energy_steady}
      \nabla \cdot \vec{q} = 0.
\end{equation} At this point it arises the question about the validity of this approach since we are considering time evolution of the internal temperatures of the Earth. However, as is pointed out by \citet{stamenkovicetal2012}, the aforementioned approximation can be justified by the fact that relaxation time of the lithosphere is typically on the order of 100 Ma. In contrast, the relaxation time of the mantle is of the order of few Ga, in other words, the latter is much grater that the former. 

Since we assume that heat flows radially outwards, then the heat flux vector is given by:
\begin{equation}
      \vec{q} = q_r \hat{\vec{r}},
\end{equation} where $\hat{\vec{r}}$ is the corresponding unit vector that is perpendicular to the spherical surfaces at each point and its sense is outwards the aforementioned surface. Taking this assumption into account, Equation~\eqref{ec:cont_eq_energy_steady} can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}\label{ec:dqrdr}
      \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d} r} \left[r^2 \, q_r (r) \right] = 0.
\end{equation} On the other hand, as we have assumed that heat is transported by conduction across the layer, the relationship between the heat flux and temperature is given by the Fourier law:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:fourier_law_gen}
      \vec{q} = - \, k \, \nabla T.
\end{equation} If we assume that temperature depends only on the radial distance:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:fourier_law_r}
      q_r = - \, k \, \frac{\text{d} T}{\text{d} r}.
\end{equation} Then, by inserting Equation~\eqref{ec:fourier_law_r} into Equation~\eqref{ec:dqrdr} and simplifying we obtain:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:d2Trdr2}
      \fdiff{}{r} \left[r^2 \, \fdiff{T (r)}{r} \right] = 0.
\end{equation} The solution of Equation~\eqref{ec:d2Trdr2} considering the boundary conditions $T(R_\text{in}) = T_\text{in}$ and $T (R_\text{out}) = T_\text{out}$ is \citep{carslaw_jaeger_1959}:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:Tdr_hollow}
      T_\text{cond} (r) = \frac{R_\text{out} \, T_\text{out} \left(r - R_\text{in}\right) + R_\text{in} T_\text{in} \left(R_\text{out} - r\right)}{\left(R_\text{out} - R_\text{in}\right) r}.
\end{equation} In the latter equation, we added the subscript ``cond'' to stress the fact that this expression is valid for conductive heat flow.

Now we move our attention to the adiabatic temperature distribution. In general terms, such temperature profile satisfies:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:adiabatic_TdP}
      \fdiff{T}{P} = \frac{\alpha \, T}{\rho \, c},
\end{equation} were $P$ is the pressure. In principle, Equation~\eqref{ec:adiabatic_TdP} cannot be solved directly because physical properties, such as $\alpha$, $\rho$, and $c$, of both the core and mantle varies with depth \citep[see e.g.][]{valenciaetal2006}. In the case of the core we consider the expression given by \citet{stevensonetal1983}:
\begin{equation}
    \label{ec:Tc_r_adia}
    T_\text{c} (r) = T_\textsc{cmb} \left[\frac{1 + T_{a,1} \, P (r) + T_{a,2} \, P^2 (r)}{1 + T_{a,1} \, P_\textsc{cmb} + T_{a,2} \, P_\textsc{cmb}^2}\right],
\end{equation} where $P_\textsc{cmb}$ is the pressure at the CMB, i.e. $P_\textsc{cmb} = P \left(R_\text{c}\right)$. The expression of the pressure as a function of the radial distance $r$ is obtained by fitting the PREM data \citep{PREM1981} to a quadratic polynomial:
\begin{equation}
    \label{ec:Pdr}
    P(r) = \begin{cases}
        367.767 - 0.0144178 \, r - 1.52163 \E{-5} \, r^2, & \text{ if } 0 \leq r \leq R_\text{c} \\
        397.012 - 0.0901277 \, r + 4.35256 \E{-6} \, r^2, & \text{ if } R_\text{c} \leq r \leq R_\oplus
    \end{cases}
\end{equation} where $P$ is given in GPa and $r$ in km.

Equation~\eqref{ec:adiabatic_TdP} can be transformed into a differential equation in which the independent variable is the radial distance by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:hidrostatic_eq}
      \fdiff{P}{r} = - \, \rho \, g.
\end{equation} Then, we arrive to:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:adiabatic_Tdr}
      \fdiff{T}{r} = \frac{\alpha \, T}{\rho \, c} \fdiff{P}{r} = - \frac{\alpha \, g \, T}{c}.
\end{equation} If we assume that the physical properties $\alpha$, $g$, and $c$ are constant, then the Equation~\eqref{ec:adiabatic_Tdr} can be solved straightforwardly:
\begin{equation}
    \label{ec:Tdr_adiabatic_gen}
    T (r) = A \, \exp \left(-\frac{\alpha \, g \, r}{c}\right),
\end{equation} where $A$ is a constant to be determined by the initial conditions. For example, by setting the general condition that the temperature is $T_0$ at the radial distance $R_0$, then:
\begin{equation}
    \label{ec:Tdr_IC}
    T (R_0) = T_0 = A \, \exp \left(-\frac{\alpha \, g \, R_0}{c}\right),
\end{equation} and consequently:
\begin{equation}
    \label{ec:Tdr_adiabatic_0}
    T (r) = T_0 \, \exp \left[\frac{\alpha \, g}{c} \left(R_0 - r\right)\right],
\end{equation} where $T_0$ can be thought as a reference temperature. When the expression given by Equation~\eqref{ec:Tdr_adiabatic_0} is evaluated at some particular value of $r$, $T$ is known as the \emph{potential temperature} \citep{mckenzie_bickle_1988}, $T_\text{pot}$. Thus, the potential temperature is the temperature a mass element would have if it were taken from that particular radius to the reference one.

Is of particular interest in the study of the mantle's thermal evolution to take as reference the temperature at the base of the upper thermal boundary layer. Thus:
\begin{equation}
    \label{ec:Tdr_adiabatic_ubl}
    T (r) = T_\textsc{ubl} \, \exp \left[\frac{\alpha \, g}{c} \left(R_\oplus - \delta_\textsc{ubl} - r\right)\right].
\end{equation} The simplest way to compute the potential temperature is at the Earth's surface ($r = R_\oplus$), where it could be easily measured. In consequence:
\begin{equation}
    \label{ec:Tpot}
    T_\text{pot} = T_\textsc{ubl} \, \exp \left(- \frac{\alpha \, g \, \delta_\textsc{ubl}}{c}\right).
\end{equation}

Concerning the temperature profile within mantle, but outside the thermal boundary layers, it is well approximated by a linear expression because mantle the adiabatic scale length is much larger than mantle thickness \citep{driscollybarnes2015}. Thus, by expanding Equation~\eqref{ec:Tdr_adiabatic_ubl} in power series and retaining up to the linear term, we arrive to:
\begin{equation}
    \label{ec:Tdr_adiabatic_linear}
    T_\text{m} (r) \approx T_\textsc{ubl} + \frac{\alpha_\text{m} \, g_\text{m} \, T_\textsc{ubl}}{c_\text{m}} \left(R_\oplus - \delta_\textsc{ubl} - r\right).
\end{equation}

Finally, the expression of the temperature profile inside the Earth is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \label{ec:Tdr_earth}
    T (r) = \begin{cases}
        T_\textsc{cmb} \left[\dfrac{1 + T_{a,1} \, P (r) + T_{a,2} \, P^2 (r)}{1 + T_{a,1} \, P_\textsc{cmb} + T_{a,2} \, P_\textsc{cmb}^2}\right] & \text{ if } 0 \leq r \leq R_\text{c} \\
         & \\
        \dfrac{\left(R_\text{c} + \delta_\textsc{lbl}\right) \, T_\textsc{lbl} \left(r - R_\text{c}\right) + R_\text{c} T_\textsc{cmb} \left(R_\text{c} + \delta_\textsc{lbl} - r\right)}{\delta_\textsc{lbl} \, r} & \text{ if } R_\text{c} \leq r \leq R_\text{c} + \delta_\textsc{lbl} \\
        & \\
        T_\textsc{ubl} + \dfrac{\alpha_\text{m} \, g_\text{m} \, T_\textsc{ubl}}{c_\text{m}} \left(R_\oplus - \delta_\textsc{ubl} - r\right) & \text{ if } R_\text{c} + \delta_\textsc{lbl} \leq r \leq R_\oplus - \delta_\textsc{ubl} \\
        & \\
        \dfrac{R_\oplus \, T_\text{s} \left(r - R_\oplus + \delta_\textsc{ubl}\right) + \left(R_\oplus - \delta_\textsc{ubl}\right) T_\textsc{ubl} \left(R_\oplus - r\right)}{\delta_\textsc{ubl} \, r} & \text{ if } R_\oplus - \delta_\textsc{ubl} \leq r \leq R_\oplus.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Expression of the heat fluxes}

As we have pointed out before, heat is transported by conduction across each thermal boundary layer, thus the corresponding heat flux ($q$) for each boundary layer is given by:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:heat_flux_gen}
      q = k_\text{m} \frac{\Delta T}{\delta},
\end{equation} where $k_\text{m}$ is the thermal conductivity, which is considered constant for the whole mantle, $\Delta T$ is the temperature jump across the corresponding boundary layer of thickness $\delta$. The thickness of the upper thermal boundary layer is obtained by virtue of the Nu-Ra relationship \citep{schubertetal2001}:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:delta_ubl}
      \delta_\textsc{ubl} = \left(R_\oplus - R_\text{c}\right) \left(\frac{\text{Ra}_\text{cr}}{\text{Ra}}\right)^\beta,
\end{equation} where $\beta$ is a real exponent. The thickness of the lower thermal boundary layer ($\delta_\textsc{lbl}$) is expected to be thinner than $\delta_\textsc{ubl}$ because of the aforementioned strong dependence of the viscosity on the temperature. For this reason $\delta_\textsc{lbl}$ is computed locally \citep{stevensonetal1983}:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:delta_lbl}
      \delta_\textsc{lbl} = \left[\frac{ \text{Ra}_\text{cr}^\text{(cmb)} \kappa \, \eta_\textsc{lbl} }{g \, \alpha_\text{m} \, \Delta T_\textsc{lbl}}\right]^{1/3},
\end{equation} where $\text{Ra}_\text{cr}^\text{(cmb)}$ is the local critical Rayleigh number at the CMB and the viscosity is evaluated at the mean temperature within the lower thermal boundary layer:
\begin{equation}
      \label{ec:visc_lbl}
      \eta_\textsc{lbl} = \eta \left(\frac{T_\textsc{lbl} + T_\textsc{cmb}}{2}\right).
\end{equation} In consequence, we have:
\begin{align}
      \label{ec:Q_cmb_Q_conv}
      \dot{Q}_\text{conv} &= A_\oplus \, k_\text{m} \frac{\Delta T_\textsc{ubl}}{\delta_\textsc{ubl}} = A_\oplus \, k_\text{m} \frac{\left(T_\textsc{ubl} - T_\text{s}\right)}{\delta_\textsc{ubl}} \\
      \dot{Q}_\textsc{cmb} &= A_\text{c} \, k_\text{m} \frac{\Delta T_\textsc{lbl}}{\delta_\textsc{lbl}} = A_\text{c} \, k_\text{m} \frac{\left(T_\textsc{cmb} - T_\textsc{lbl}\right)}{\delta_\textsc{lbl}} \\
\end{align}
